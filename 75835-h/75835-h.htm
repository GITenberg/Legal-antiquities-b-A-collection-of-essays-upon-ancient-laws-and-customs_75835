<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

</div>

<p>In this age of ours, distinguished principally for the
variety of the inventions and the fast and furious pace
at which we move; when the motto of the Captains of
Industry, being paraphrased, is simply, that “Motion
means Money”; when the politicians vie with each
other in their attempts to cater to every passing popular
fantasy and the great mass of the citizenship is too
much engrossed in the commercial life of the day, to
study or analyze the history of our institutions, but the
demand of the times is for continuous change, in keeping
with the moving spirit of the age, it is advisable that
we should occasionally stop and consider the lessons of
the past, lest we forget some of the valuable information
of antiquity.</p>

<p>There was perhaps never a time, in the history of
our country, when the general feeling of individual unrest
has brought about such disrespect for our existing
institutions.</p>

<p>The development of the great body of our law, from
the brutalities of a barbarous period, with the ever
changing ideas of civilization, to meet the needs of the
people, and the higher standards obtaining, has been
gradual but certain. In so far as we have actually progressed,
therefore, we should be satisfied with the progress
made and should be slow to return to the customs
or remedies which a past civilization found unavailing,
lest all our progress should prove but a dim phantom
of the imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>A profitable lesson can oftimes be gleaned from a
study of the past and when an innovation demanded is
one that experience has proven fallacious, it is puerile
to refuse to profit by this lesson, for even “a burnt
child” will avoid the fire.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly much of the remedial and substantive
law of our period needs revision, to the end that simplicity
may be attained and the interminable delays, resulting
from the present practice, incidental to too
many new trials and other objectionable methods, obviated.
But this revision should be cautiously made, so
as not to impair the efficiency of the great body of the
law that the wisdom of the past has demonstrated to be
thoroughly consistent with the individual and national
welfare.</p>

<p>The first attempt to simplify procedure in the United
States, by the adoption of the New York Code, was only
sixty-five years ago and a majority of the States
adopted such legislation since the Civil War. The common
law practice was greatly improved and simplified
by this concerted action of the States and unquestionably
there are many things that can yet be improved
in the remedial procedure of the present day.</p>

<p>But the prevalent idea that an increased volume of
statute law will furnish a panacea for all existing evils,
is radically wrong. The beneficent rules of conduct,
crystallized into law, by custom, because consistent
with the needs of the people, in the evolution of civilization,
should be jealously preserved against the unscientific
fragmentary legislation, too often reflecting the unjust
and unequal demands of an aroused public sentiment,
shaped by designing politicians, rather than by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
the “cool examiner of the public pulse,” prompted by
beneficent objects.</p>

<p>Legislation, of course, is the simplest way of modifying
or repealing law, but legislators, in our country, frequently
act without adequate information or legal
training and the most salutary rule of conduct, in such
hands, might be supplanted by the most unequal and unjust
law.</p>

<p>All that is old is not necessarily good, but just because
it is old, is not a sufficient reason for discarding
it. Legislation may become as limitless as the imagination
of the legislator and unless properly advised, it
would be inimical to the interests of the State or Nation.</p>

<p>When legislation is advised by any considerable
number of the leaders of any political party, which
history has shown in other countries to have been productive
of the most deplorable consequences, then it is
time to leave the issues of the present long enough to
study the lessons of the past.</p>

<p>In conning the “Marriage Laws and Customs” of
past ages, we can, in some measure, congratulate ourselves
that our Marriage Laws are better than those of
the past centuries, yet when we consider the large class
of “Predestined Lost” ones, born as a result of diseased
and mismated marriages, and when we give but
a cursory examination to the divorce statistics, we can
see that we have grave need for better laws on this
most important of all subjects, the regulation of the
relation, through which the standards of citizenship are
controled.</p>

<p>The Witch-Craze, in Europe and America, which resulted
in the wholesale slaughter of innocents, through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
a blind faith by the Courts, in the popular standards of
the people, whereby unprovable offenses, were permitted
to be established in utter disregard of the rules of
evidence, and a vacillating, dependent judiciary helped
for centuries, to perpetrate the most intolerable outrages
against civilization, illustrates the necessity of an
absolutely independent judiciary, free from the dominating
influence of the frenzy of the public and a constant
adherence to the rules of evidence and the proper
legal ideals, in the administration of the law.</p>

<p>The Judicial Recall, as we see it in ancient history,
is another of the present popular fantasies to be
avoided. Hammurabi tried this system 2,500 years before
Christ’s time, when witches were convicted according
to their ability to swim a torrent and surgeons were
mutilated, by the loss of a hand, for an unsuccessful
operation. It was also tried in ancient Athens and because
of some unpopular decision, the “most just
Judge” of that city, Aristides, was recalled, and some
votes were cast against him, because the voters were
simply tired of hearing him called “The Just.” Aristotle’s
evidence is to the effect that this law brought
about the most deplorable consequences, in Greece,
Persia and other antique nations, where it was in vogue.
The old Anglo-Saxon practice of preferring the charge
of “False Judgment” against the judge whose decision
was challenged, who was recalled, if this charge was
sustained, was found inimical to the interest of the
Government and since the English Judges were emancipated
from the narrow groove of an unskilled public
sentiment and were appointed for life, the majesty of
the law has been revered in no other country on the face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
of the earth, as it has been in England. This is testimony
worth considering, for, judging the future by the
past, if this practice undermined the judicial institutions
of other countries, it would also undermine our
own judicial system and ought to be avoided. The demand,
by the ill-formed, for the destruction of the independence
of the Judiciary, in utter disregard of the
lessons of the past and the wisdom of our fathers,
should be considered, therefore, along with this object
lesson furnished by ancient history and by penetrating
into the records of the past centuries, it will be seen that
to adopt such a law would mean to return to the “Leges
Barbarorum” of the past.</p>

<p>In the discharge of their impartial functions, the
judges of the people’s courts, have nothing to do with
popular standards; it is with right and wrong, according
to the just and equal standards of the law that they
have to deal and it is as true to-day, as when the patriarch
Moses, admonished the judges of ancient Israel,
that, in the prerogative of the judgment-seat, “Thou
shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt
thou speak in a cause to decline after many, to wrest
judgment.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The work of the judges is in private places; they have
no favors to bestow, no rewards of office to distribute.
It is frequently the business of the charlatan to misconstrue
and misinterpret their ablest judgments and as
the courts are the final repositories of the people’s
rights, when the public clamor is the loudest for the sacrifice
of individual right, then the true judicial character
performs its highest office, in withstanding all assaults<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
by the ill-informed, upon the ramparts of the
Temple of Justice.</p>

<p>With the wide-spread demand for the “judicial recall”
we find the true modern standard, in this regard,
reflected in the recent strong language of an upright
Texas Judge, who, in the course of his opinion, observed:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have made it the rule of my judicial life, and shall
continue to do so, while invested with the authority pertaining
to the office I hold, to decide questions as I understand
them, after as careful an investigation as my
capacity affords, without reference to what public opinion
may be. I do and shall continue to regard the law as
superior to the ebullition of outraged feeling, when communities
are shocked by crime. When cases arising
under such circumstances, have reached this court, my
voice and my vote shall, in the future, as in the past,
be given for the upholding of the law, not bending it
to public sentiment. The stability of the institutions of
this government depends upon adherence to the law, as
it is written, and not on the fluctuating strenuousity of
eruptive ebullitions of popular sentiment.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This course alone is consistent with the attainment of
the just idea of government, by the judicial department,
and peculiarly of this department, because the ideals of
the unskilled are not always consistent with the standards
of scientific jurisprudence. A subservient judiciary,
dependent upon the vacillating ebullitions of an
unstable public sentiment would bring about a subversion
of the important functions of this department of
government, just as it did when popular sentiment controlled
the incumbents of the judgment seat, in ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
Babylon, in Greece and in the England of old Anglo-Saxon days.</p>

<p>“Trial by Ordeal,” “Trial by Battle,” the dreadful
“<i>Peine forte et dure</i>,” and “Wager of Law,” are all
instructive procedures of a past civilization, from which
important lessons can be drawn.</p>

<p>“Trial by Ordeal,” “Trial by Battle” and “Wager of
Law,” as institutions of a primitive people, struggling
for right, are but expressions of a misguided and abortive
effort to attain correct judicial ideals, by false and
inaccurate standards. Before the evolution of the race
had attained to the ideals, when tribunals for the trial of
questions of right and wrong, according to the actual
facts in each concrete case, had been established, such
issues were determined by the ability of the accused, in
criminal cases, or the appellee, in civil suits, of a certain
character to accomplish certain ordeals, requiring almost
superhuman strength or fortitude, or to withstand,
by individual combat, the strength of the opposite party
to the issue waged. Of course, with such ideals, might
alone controled the right and by the “Wager of Law,”
the other alternative used in the quest for right, the
popularity of the principal or his ability to secure oath-helpers,
to assist him in swearing away the given crime
or debt, resolved the conclusion upon a given issue, into
a simple question of the elasticity of the consciences of
the principal and his friends, who were always able to
win their cause, after issue waged, by a sufficiently
strong and an adequate number of oaths.</p>

<p>On the abolition of the “Ordeal,” in the thirteenth
century, when the accused, in a criminal charge, refused
to submit to a “Trial by Battle,” the courts were unable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
to force a plea, without some amendment of the
procedure and adroit criminal lawyers, for some years,
availed themselves of this subterfuge, of having their
clients stand mute and refuse to plead, when their conviction
of felony would be certain to result and the
courts found themselves helpless to avoid a condition,
which resulted in the crowding of the jails and prisons,
with prisoners, afraid to submit to the “Trial by
Battle” and refusing to plead to the indictments filed
against them. This, in time, brought about the greatest
judicial severity in the case of prisoners standing mute
and finally the practice, in all such cases, came to be to
apply a heavy weight upon the chest of the accused and
to literally “press him to death,” if he persisted in his
obstinacy. For centuries, in England, this custom continued,
and thousands were “pressed to death,” for
standing mute, when arraigned upon a criminal charge.
The same practice was followed in the witch persecutions
in this country, in the seventeenth century and
when we consider that these abominable customs obtained,
until the past century, we are, indeed, to be congratulated
that our present procedure, with all of its
imperfections, has risen to the standard where it is able
to reject such inhuman and barbarous practices.</p>

<p>The “Benefit of Clergy” and “Privilege of Sanctuary,”
illustrate the attempt of the Church to mollify, as
it were, the cruelties resulting from the harsh administration
of the criminal laws of mediaeval times, in England,
by the secular courts and had it not been for these
beneficent institutions—which were frequently utilized
to protect criminals of the worst sort—there would
have been no alleviation for the sufferings of the accused,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
and the large number of innocents who embraced
the plea of Clergy, or sought the sacred precincts of the
protected Sanctuary, would, along with the guilty, have
paid the penalty for living in a dark and benighted age,
unable to protect the innocent from the power of the
mighty, when accused of wrong-doing.</p>

<p>When we read of the “Ancient Punishments” of the
past centuries, we can but feel a satisfaction that the
struggle of our English forefathers of mediaeval times,
by herculean efforts against those in authority, adopted
such fixed principles of constitutional law, as we find
reflected in <i>Magna Charta</i>, and the various constitutions
of our own country, preventing “cruel and unusual
punishment.”</p>

<p>Those so fortunate as to avoid the punishments of the
past centuries, when death lurked in every charge filed
against the poor and oppressed, must have felt a sort
of consolation in being able to run the gauntlet of such
barbarities and delusions, and to die a natural death,
and this is no doubt why we find such evidence of jocularity,
mixed with a strain of pathos running through
the “Quaint and Curious Wills” and testaments of antiquity.</p>

<p>Some of the great painters of modern times, such as
the late Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, have depicted
scenes upon the canvas, in such manner as to make antiquity
to live again before modern eyes—to resurrect,
as it were, the men and women of the past centuries and
to infuse new life into their bodies—so that they seem
to again assume real form and being.</p>

<p>This comes from a close study of the subjects and a
genius, almost akin to a divine gift. No such gift can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
aid the lawyer, or did in this instance, who seeks to reproduce
pen pictures of the antique proceedings of the
past, but study of the subject is of course essential to
give any tolerable idea of the obsolete laws and customs
of other days.</p>

<p>A keen interest in these old proceedings prompted a
somewhat painstaking study of many antique volumes,
as a basis for the presentation of the following pages,
but the duties of a quite busy professional life have prevented
the exhaustive investigation that would otherwise
have been given the subjects treated.</p>

<p>The sources of the information used in the different
essays appear in notes and references throughout the
work and it is to be hoped, if the usual modicum of instruction
may be lacking, that some of the interest felt
by the author, in tracing the old laws and customs of
previous ages, may, in a measure, be shared, by the
reader, who is kind enough to peruse the work.</p>

<p>Not nearly all the learning or the law upon any one
of the subjects presented, will be found set forth in the
different paragraphs pertaining to the various subjects
introduced, but a general outline of each topic, with frequent
illustrations from concrete cases, will appear.</p>

<p>None of the many legal antiquities of the Grecian
States or the Roman Empire, which could be so profitably
discussed, have been attempted, but only a few of
the antique English laws and customs that have particularly
attracted the attention of the author. These several
subjects were all given cursory examinations in the
preparation of the data for “Law in Shakespeare” and
the superficial investigation in connection with that
work, led to the more minute treatment herein. This is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
the apology for the undertaking and the engrossment
of professional duties is the excuse for the limited
scope of the treatment accorded each subject.</p>

<p>With the era now existing, these old issues and customs
are dead and buried out of sight and we would not
be mad enough to revive them, if we could. They
played no unimportant part, however, in the pathetic
drama of the evolution of the race and we ought to
erect monuments to their memory, as it were, and occasionally
wander back to scatter flowers upon the monumental
shaft, without deserting the live issues and
duties at present confronting us.</p>

<p>When we contemplate the lessons of the past, as presented
in these “Legal Antiquities,” we can but realize
the plain truth, expressed by William Knox, that “We
are the same our fathers have been,” for if we had
lived and moved and had our being in the dark days
when these customs obtained, we would have considered
them in the same light that our fore-fathers viewed
them and this should make us charitable toward these
frailties and mistakes of the past; we should be comforted
with the reflection that such institutions are but
mile-stones of the centuries, marking the rapid progress
of the race, but when we read of these customs
of the men and women of antiquity, we can but realize
the truth of the words of Longfellow, that</p>

including an inseparable association of their lives.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

of the Romans.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>As the basis of the marriage contract is the necessity
of society for some rule for the appropriation of the
opposite sexes to one another and the protection of that
relation, when once established, it is in one form or another,
the oldest institution of man and the source of
our most antique laws and customs.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The Chinese inform us that in the beginning, human
beings, like other animals, without morality or community
laws, wandered through the plains and forests, using
their women in common; that the offspring of such
unions knew their mothers, but rarely knew who their
fathers were and that this custom continued among
men, until the Emperor Fou-hi established the marriage
custom.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>While the ancient “Heathen Chinese” were thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
holding their women in common, there is evidence that
among the old Teutons and Hindus, the “marriage by
capture” and “rape marriages” were still recognized
by law, long before the “bride-sale” or “sale marriages,”
so generally obtaining in ancient Assyria and
Babylon, were established in Germany.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Some historians claim that, in the early days of
heathenry, capture was the only method used by young
men for securing their brides and the supply of consorts
depended upon the strength of the male, rather
than the existence of “the tender passion.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>But the pictures of violence obtaining in these ancient
days of heathenry are so obscured by the mists
of the past and such a large field is left for the construction
of ingenious theories, surrounded by romances
of connubial bliss, resulting from this early custom
of primitive society, that notwithstanding the general
popularity of the theory of “marriage by capture,”
some of the most eminent authorities are inclined to
deny that such a custom ever existed at all.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Some writers maintain that the rights of the individual
were never more clearly defined in marriage, than
by primitive man, and that this is in accord with the
common tendency of the male, to attribute a religious
meaning to the ordinary intercourse with woman.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The Biblical theory of the custom, dates from the
command to our first parents, in Genesis: “Be fruitful,
and multiply and replenish the earth.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>In the beginning, we find that from the rib, which
the Lord had taken from Adam, he made a woman
“<i>and he brought her unto the man</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>From Christian testimony, we have the evidence of
the first book of Moses, upon the antiquity of this institution,
for when Shechem, the son of Hamor, after defiling
Dinah, the daughter of Leah, longed for her, in
marriage, his father went to Jacob and his sons and
communed with them, saying: “The soul of my son
Shechem longeth for your daughter; I pray you give
her him to wife. And make ye marriages with us, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
give your daughters unto us and take our daughters
unto you.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>So according to the Bible story, we find that the institution
of marriage obtained seventeen centuries before
Christ and these old patriarchs were plighting the
troth of their son and daughter and talking of dowries
and marriage portions, much as the parents of the
twentieth century youth now arrange such matters.</p>

<p>There has always been three principal forms of marriage,
from the earliest historical times, monogamy, or
the marriage of one man to one woman at a time, polygamy,
or the marriage of one man to several women at
the same time, and polyandry, or the marriage of one
woman to two or more husbands at the same time.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Since the days of our first parents, according to the
Bible story, monogamy has been the institution best
suited to the progress of society and the proper evolution
of the human race, for the most progressive nations
of the world’s history have embraced monogamy as a
rule of social conduct.</p>

<p>The old Hebrews, however, made wonderful strides
while practicing polygamy, an institution established by
Lamech, in the sixth generation after Adam, which grew
apace with the progress of the race, until in Solomon’s
time, the king had acquired a round thousand women,
from the different nationalities of the world, seven
hundred princesses as wives and three hundred concubines.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Polygamy was also practiced in Persia and is to-day,
in Turkey and other Oriental countries, but under Roman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
rule it slowly died out in the east. It was prohibited
by Diocletian and other preceding Emperors
and except in the single instance of the Mormons, in
Utah, it has never reappeared in any countries subject
to either the Roman or Teutonic laws.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Polyandry no doubt had its origin in unfertile regions,
in the endeavor to limit the population to the resources
of the district; it is almost an obsolete custom,
but is still practiced in parts of India, Thibet and Ceylon.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The marriage customs of the Romans furnish the
basis for the marriage laws of the civilized world, and
even the Hebrew and Teutonic influence is small compared
to that exerted upon this institution, by the Roman
law. The general conception of the marriage relation,
by the Romans, was an exalted one, as it was
regarded as an equal partnership in the whole of life,
effecting an equal distribution in both the secular and
sacred rights of the individuals.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The three forms of marriage, by the early Roman
law, were (1) <i>Confarreatio</i>, consisting of a religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
ceremony, ending in the sacrifice of an ox, and the distribution
of a broken wheaten cake, by a priest; (2)
<i>Coemptio in manum</i>, a conveyance or formal sale of the
woman, to the man, and (3) <i>Usus</i>, or the right of a wife,
by prescription, arising from the cohabitation of the
wife with the husband, for one year, without an absence
for over three consecutive nights.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>If the woman lived with the man without either the
religious ceremony or the formal sale, she did not become
his wife, unless she had lived with him for a year,
without absenting herself for three consecutive nights.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>This latter form was called “passing into the hand”
of her husband and until this Hand power had been created,
the property rights of the wife remained unaffected
by the marriage. Marriages with Hand in an
early day were almost universal, however, for the
women did not prefer the free marriage, which would
place them, in law, outside the legal family of the husband.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Marriages within the Levitical degrees were
prohibited by the early Roman Emperors, and while
first cousins might lawfully marry, until the end of the
Republic,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the Emperor Theodosius prohibited their
marriage under pain of death by burning.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>Uncles and nieces and aunts and nephews were prohibited
from marrying, until the period of the Emperor
Claudius, who desired to marry his brother’s daughter,
Agrippina, and so passed a decree of the Senate allowing
such a marriage.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Concubinage was a “permitted connection,” under
the Roman law, from the earliest times, down to the period
of the philosopher Emperor, Leo, A. D. 887 when
it was prohibited by law.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The Justinian Code recognized
the legality of the relation and fixed the legal and
property status of the concubine and her progeny and
various Christian Emperors, in the early days of the
Empire passed laws regulating the relation known as
<i>Concubinatus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The woman was left in the same relation as the law
found her; she was not raised to the level of the husband
and while her children were entitled to support
from the father, they were not legitimate, but could inherit
from the mother.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Under the Roman law, however,
children born in concubinage, could be legitimated
by the subsequent marriage of their parents,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and this
early Roman law was the foundation for the custom
obtaining in England, France, Germany, Normandy and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
Scotland, prior to the Norman Conquest, of legitimating
the children born out of lawful wedlock, by the subsequent
marriage of their parents. At the wedding of
a couple having children prior to their marriage, it was
the general custom, in the countries named, to place the
children under a cloak, or mantle, which was also
spread over the parents, and the children of such a
union were thereafter known in the law, as “mantle
children,” to distinguish them from children regularly
born in lawful wedlock.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>According to Selden, this ceremony was observed, in
England, when the children of John of Gaunt and Catherine
Swinford were legitimated by Parliament,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and
in Normandy, Duke Richard espoused Gunnora, “in
Christian fashion,” and “the children were covered
with the mantle.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>Neither the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, Mohammedans
or Romans, regarded marriage as a religious ordinance,
but the relation could be established, according to the
laws and customs of all these ancient people, by the
interchange of consent.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>In Cnut’s time, in England, we find that he made laws
to prevent the sale of a woman to a man whom she disliked,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
but even at this stage of English society, the
church approved these sale marriages and condoned the
old betrothals of the Anglo-Saxons, and preserved the
forms of ceremonies which still constitute the curious
cabinet of antiquities of the English church.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The early Christian church, however, did not treat
marriage as a sacrament; the doctrine that marriage
was a sacrament was evolved from the Fifth Chapter
of the Epistle of St. Paul, to the Ephesians and it was
not until the Council of Trent, in the year 1563 that the
Roman Catholic Church required the celebration of
marriage to be accompanied by a religious ceremony.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>In England, as early as the seventh century, the concern
of the church about all sins pertaining to the
flesh, caused it to raise its voice upon questions concerning
marriage and divorce.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>By the middle of the twelfth century according to the
laws of England, marriage was held to appertain to
the spiritual forum.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>In the memorable law suit of Richard de Anesty, in
1143, a marriage solemnly celebrated by the church, and
from which a child had been born, was declared to be
void in favor of a prior marriage, constituted by a mere
exchange of consenting words, without the formality of
a religious ceremony at all.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Soon after this decision, Glanville acknowledged the
jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts upon all issues
touching the validity of marriage and because of the
acknowledged inability of the king’s court to solve the
issue, where the legitimacy of a litigant had been
raised, the canon law was subsequently looked to in all
such cases.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>In 1215, at the Council of Lateran, Pope Innocent III.
extended to the whole western portion of Christendom
the custom of publishing “banns of marriage,” calling
upon all men to declare any just cause of impediment, if
any could be urged to the union and from this time on,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
marriages with banns, had certain legal advantages
over a marriage without banns, but still the unblessed,
formless marriage was a marriage, before the law.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Henry II., Alexander III. decreed
that a marriage by mere consent, in terms of a present,
existing contract, would be given precedence over a
later marriage by another man with the same woman,
duly solemnized in religious form, and followed by
physical union.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> It seems a strong case, to give effect
to the bare consent, in present form, “unhallowed and
unconsummated” as against a solemn formal contract,
followed by a consummated union, yet this decree was
consistent with the ecclesiastical law, as interpreted
from the middle of the twelfth century until the Council
of Trent, and no religious ceremony or the presence
of a priest was essential to constitute a valid marriage,
before the catholic church.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>In 1254 the interesting case of William de Cardunville,
a tenant in chief of the Crown, came before the
court, upon an <i>inquisitio post-mortem</i>, to determine
which of two conflicting claimants was his rightful heir.
He had solemnly espoused one Alice, with whom he had
lived for sixteen years and had several children, the
youngest being a son, four years old, named Richard.
Long before his espousel of Alice, he had lived with and
had a son by one Joan, and this son was also named
Richard and was twenty-four years old at the death of
his father. Joan established a common-law marriage,
without the religious ceremony, and she was adjudged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
the rightful wife of the deceased and her son, the first
begotten Richard, was awarded the livery.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>From an early date, the interpretation of the English
Courts, as to the validity of a marriage based upon
a present mutual consent of the parties, was followed
in the United States, with the exception of Massachusetts,
Maryland, West Virginia and Kentucky.</p>

<p>In the year 1810, Chief Justice Parsons, then on the
bench of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, rendered
a decision, in which he denied that according to the
common law a valid marriage could be made, by the
mutual agreement of the parties alone.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Chancellor Kent, however, in 1809, as Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court of New York, held that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No formal solemnization of marriage was requisite.
A contract of marriage, made <i>per verba de praesenti</i>,
amounts to an actual marriage and is as valid as if
made <i>in facie ecclesiae</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This latter exposition of the common law of England
has been generally followed in the United States, and
may be said to obtain, generally, in all the states, other
than those mentioned above, except where the local
statutes provide otherwise.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Clearly, by the law of nature, marriage may be constituted
by the mutual present consent of two competent
persons, of the opposite sex, without other formality
than the performed inclination of the individuals
concerned and so the common, or unwritten law, recognized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
the legality of such a contract. The law of nature
was adopted as the surest guide to the law of man, in
this relation.</p>

<p>Considerable uncertainty and some confusion resulted
in England as to the essentials of a valid marriage
and the acts necessary to constitute a marriage,
prior to the eighteenth century, but during the reign of
George II., in 1753, a statute was passed,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> requiring all
marriages to be celebrated by a clergyman and in a
church, unless by special dispensation by the Archbishop
of Canterbury. This statute was repealed in
1836 when a purely civil marriage before only a Registrar,
was permitted by the law of England, in lieu of
the ecclesiastical ceremony.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Touching the issue as to the validity of a marriage
not solemnized by religious ceremony, is the interesting
and famous case of The Queen vs. Millis,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> wherein the
House of Lords, erroneously decided that such a marriage
was void, according to the English law, in the
year 1843.</p>

<p>The Irish Court of King’s Bench was equally divided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
upon the issue and in the House of Lords, after
the decision of the English judges had been given
against the validity of the marriage at which no clergyman
had been present, Lords Lyndhurst, Cottenham
and Abinger were for holding the marriage void, while
Lords Brougham, Denman and Campbell, were in favor
of its validity, but on account of the precise form in
which the question was put to the House, the effect of
the division was to hold the marriage void, and thus a
mere accident gave the decision in favor of the erroneous
view that from the earliest time in English law, the
presence of an ordained clergyman was essential to the
celebration of a valid marriage, when, as we have seen,
from the decisions and history of the law, this was not
the case, either in England or according to the Roman
law, until the Council of Trent.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>But while both the temporal and spiritual courts
recognized the validity of marriages based alone upon
mutual consent, followed by a physical union, the religious
ceremony in an early day, was held essential to
endow the wife with the right to the husband’s land.
Bracton tells us that the endowment can only be made at
the church door, for while the marriage may be contracted
elsewhere, the bride can only be endowed at the
door of the church.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>This rule, however, was of course inconsistent with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
the recognition of the validity of the marriage and both
the ecclesiastic and temporal courts went to the extreme
limit to legitimize the offspring of marriages, not
the result of a wilful criminal relation. Retroactive and
putative marriages were recognized, both in the temporal
and ecclesiastical courts, when the legitimacy of
children depended upon such a construction and in
cases where the parents had married within the prohibited
degrees of consanguinity, or if a woman, in good
faith, married a man already married and believed that
he was single and had children by him, the children
would be held legitimate and capable of inheriting, under
the law.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The courts, in order to legitimize the offspring of
doubtful marriages, went the full limit, in upholding
the marriage relation from a very early day, but the
consort who abandoned her husband to dwell with her
adulterer, was written beyond the pale of the law. By
an old statute, of the reign of Edward I., a woman who
eloped and abode with her adulterer was punished by a
loss of dower<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and this statute was enforced, in the
case of William and Margaret Paynel, which originated
in 1302.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>These parties petitioned the king for dower that was
due the woman, as the widow of her first husband, John
de Camoys. It was charged that Margaret had eloped
with William and committed adultery with him. In
answer, William and Margaret produced a solemn charter,
whereby her first husband had “given, granted, released<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
and quit-claimed” the said Margaret to William.
They also introduced evidence to the effect that after
they went to live together they had been charged with
adultery in the court Christian, and that by the oath of
compurgators, among whom were married and unmarried
ladies and a prioress, they had successfully met
this charge and they offered to leave to the decision of
a jury the issue whether or not they were guilty of
adultery in living together. The court, however, in
a lengthy decree, held that the facts on their face constituted
adultery and since no reconciliation of the first
husband was shown, the woman was not entitled to
dower, under this statute.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>This illustrates the easy morality of the olden times,
so contrary to our present standards, touching the marital
relation, yet this case is not a parallel to many
which could be cited in the golden days of Greece and
Rome. So little sanctity was attached to the marital
relation in Greece, even in the days of Pericles, that
men were accustomed to loan their wives to their
friends and the literature of the period made poetry of
marital infidelity and fornication and adultery seemed
about the commonest employment of both individuals
and gods and goddesses. The Romans had more of
the religious tendencies than the Greeks, but it is said
that the Younger Cato loaned his wife, Marcia, to the
orator Hortensius and took her back again, after his
death.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>Such conduct seems almost unbelievable, because so
contrary to the natural moral instincts, yet the natural
selection between two adults of the opposite sexes, although
in derogation of the rights of the life-partner of
either, seems hardly so depraved as the consent by the
natural parents, to the marriage of infants of tender
years, which custom was so prevalent in England and
France in the past centuries.</p>

<p>During the middle ages, in England, the marriages
of little children were frequently arranged by their parents,
for the purpose of avoiding wardship and to prevent
the children from forming improper attachments,
or to effect advantageous family connections for the
parents.</p>

<p>History records that Thomas, Lord Berkeley, was
contracted to Margaret, daughter of Gerald Warren,
Lord Lisle, in the forty-first year of Edward III., when
the girl was only seven years old, and because of her
tender years, it was stipulated that she should remain
with her father for four years, but on account of sickness
in the family, they were married when she was
eight years old.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Maurice, fourth Lord Berkeley, was knighted at
seven years of age, to prevent his wardship, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
married at the age of eight, to Elizabeth, daughter of
Lord Spencer, when the bride was also but eight years
old.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Hundreds of similar cases could be mentioned in
France and England, and in tropical countries, where
the women develop at an earlier age, the marriages
occur at a corresponding earlier age. In Brazil, in the
past century parents married their children when still
in years of infancy and the case of a Brazilian traveler,
enroute to England, who demanded a half-fare ticket
for his wife, who was under twelve years of age, occurred
in the year 1853.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>We are also told that the Hungarians of the seventeenth
century often betrothed their children while still
in their cradles, and the marriages were celebrated at
the earliest possible age.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The law, which can never rise superior to the prevalent
sense of right in a given community, recognized the
validity of these child marriages, in these several countries,
just as it validated the “sale marriages” of the
old Saxon days<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and in early feudal times recognized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
the validity of exactions known as “Maiden-rent,” a
sum paid to the Lord of the Manor, in the nature of a
fine, in consideration of his relinquishment of his accustomed
right of spending the first night with the bride
of his tenant.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>As the relics of a barbarous age, such licentious customs,
like the evidences of genius and depravity frequently
found co-existent in the same individual, are interesting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
from a historical standpoint, as existing facts
connected with the given institutions of a past age and
also because many of the ancient customs, in altered
form, furnish the basis for the later customs and practices,
gradually changed, with the passing years, to
meet the different conditions and institutions of later
periods.</p>

<p>The custom of giving a dowry, or marriage portion,
which has obtained from an ancient period, is no doubt
the result of the old practice of paying for the wife in
money, the presents, land, or sums paid by way of settlement
being a mere modification of the old sale and
purchase of the bride by the husband.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>In patriarchial days, we find Shechem, the son of
Hamer, negotiating with old Jacob and his sons, for
the marriage of Dinah and he said unto them: “Ask
me never so much dowry and gift and I will give according
as ye shall say unto me; but give me the damsel to
wife.”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The <i>donatio propter nuptias</i>,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> of the Romans, and
the old marriage dowry, the source of so much legislation
and litigation in ancient England, France and other
continental countries, is traceable, directly or indirectly
to this old practice. Indeed, the oldest known laws
treat of the marriage dowry, as we find that the code
of Hammurabi, written 2250 years before Christ provided
for the return of the dowry, in case of the divorcement
of a barren wife.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>Money was given the bride, from an early day in
France, and we find that when Clovis married the Princess
Clotilde, he sent, by proxy, a sou and a denier,
which became by law, the usual marriage offering, in
that country.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Caesar speaks of the marriage settlement,
as a custom he found to exist amount the ancient
Gauls;<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> it obtained among the Hebrews, at an early
date<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and has come to be a part of the marriage laws
of most of the civilized countries.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Under the old Angle-Saxon law, dower could be assigned
only at the church door.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Speaking on this subject,
Littleton says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When he cometh to the church door to be married
there, after affiance and troth plighted, he endoweth the
woman of his whole land, or of the half, of other lesser
part thereof, and there openly doth declare the quantity
and the certainty of the land she shall have for her
dower.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Accordingly, we find, when Edward I. married Marguerite
of France, in 1299, he endowed her at the door
of Canterbury Cathedral, in order that the gift could be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
witnessed by all the persons who had assembled to see
the marriage ceremony.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Selden says that the use of marriage rings, grew out
of the old custom of giving the bride a dowry, the ring
being given as a symbol of the husband’s good will, in
lieu of the dowry money, of previous days.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>However this may be, the custom of giving wedding
rings to the bride dates from an early period. We find
that Isaac propitiated the favor of Rebekah by presenting
her with a massive ear-ring and two bracelets.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
The betrothal ring was used in ancient Rome, and the
Christian church no doubt adopted the wedding ring,
from the pagan custom of the Italians, as a convenient
sign of marriage.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>In the ninth century the ring was used by the Romans
for betrothal purposes and not as an insignia of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
marriage;<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> it was used by the Anglo-Saxons, on the betrothal
of their infant children, the ring being placed
on the right hand, until the marriage, when it was transferred
to the left,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and thus grew the custom, until
finally, it became a part of the English law, that a wedding
ring should be used at all church marriages.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
This custom is still retained by the Catholics, among
whom the ring is consecrated by the priest, sprinkled
with holy water, in the form of a cross and then returned
to the bridegroom.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The superstitions of olden times, which attached to
the marriage ceremony, as celebrated in the early days
of “little knowledge,” as some writers refer to the antique
periods of the human race, are also responsible
for the present custom of throwing rice, old shoes,
stockings, bouquets, and such like practices, at marriages.</p>

<p>The custom of throwing rice was no doubt borrowed
from the ancient Persians, as rice was no inconsiderable
portion of the marriage ceremony in Persia.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Rice was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
considered an emblem of fruitfulness and the contracting
parties, after their betrothal, met at midnight, on a
bed, in the presence of two sponsors. The sponsor for
the man, touched the woman’s forehead and asked her
if she would have the man; the same ceremony was gone
through with by the sponsor for the woman and the
hands of the contracting parties were then joined and
rice was scattered over them and prayers for their
fruitfulness were offered.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Rice also constitutes an important part in the marriages
of the Hindus, the Brahmins, Javanese, the inhabitants
of Elba and is quite generally used, in other
European countries.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>The custom of throwing a shoe after the bridal couple,
so generally followed, in England, Scotland and the
United States, as a token of good luck, is directly traceable
to the old Jewish law, making the shoe a sign of
renunciation of dominion or authority, as well as a symbol
of exchange.</p>

<p>Thus, under the Mosaic law, the brother of a childless
man was bound to marry his widow and until he renounced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
his right, she could not marry another. If refused,
the woman was obliged to “loose his shoe from
off his foot” and “spit before his face,” as an assertion
of her complete independence.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The custom was followed,
according to Bible evidence, in the espousal between
Ruth and Boaz, for “as it was the custom in
Israel concerning changing, that a man plucked off his
shoe and delivered it to his neighbor,” so the kinsman
of this famous woman plucked off his shoe and gave it
to Boaz, as a token of his renunciation of Ruth and of
Boaz’s right to marry her.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>That this custom was later used by the early Christians,
would seem to be confirmed by the story connected
with the proposal of the Emperor Vladimir to the
daughter of Raguald, for when asked if she would not
marry the Emperor, she replied: “I will not take off
my shoe to the son of a slave.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> And as a part of the
betrothal, in the early Anglo-Saxon days, we read that
when the marriage was completed, the father of the
bride took off her shoe and handed it to the bridegroom,
who touched her on the head with it, as a token of the
exchange and of his power over her.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Stocking throwing, at weddings, in England, has existed
from a very early day and is said to be purely a
British custom.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>A letter describing the marriage, at court, of Sir
Philip Herbert, in 1604, says that “at night there was
sewing into the sheet, casting off the bride’s left hose,
with many other pretty sorceries.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>In Fletcher’s Poems, written in 1656, is a verse descriptive
of Clarinda’s wedding, referring to this old
custom:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“This clutter o’er, Clarinda lay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Half-bedded, like the peeping day</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Behind Olympus’ cap;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whiles at her head each twitt’ring girle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fatal stocking quick did whirle</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To know the lucky hap.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is reported that this custom, as well as that of putting
the bride to bed, was followed at the wedding of
Mary, Queen of Scots, to Lord Darnley; that the same
ceremony was gone through with, at the wedding of
Mary II. and the sedate Prince of Orange and that this
custom was followed at nearly all the marriages of the
crowned heads during the middle ages, in England, until
George III. set aside the joyful custom of “posset-drinking
and stocking throwing,” on his wedding night.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>The common law liability of the community property
of the wife and her husband for the ante-nuptial debts
of his wife, gave rise to a peculiar custom, in England,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
known as “Smock-marriages,” or “Marriage in a
Shift.” This custom obtained from early Saxon days
into the eighteenth century and the debtor bride often
came to the wedding arrayed only in a plain white
“smock” or “shift,” as a public declaration or warning
to her creditors that she took no property to her
husband, as a basis for charging him with responsibility
for her debts.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>This eccentric custom, known as “marriage in a
smock,” in England, under which a widow was married
with nothing on but a “shift,” or “smock,” upon the
theory that her second husband would thereby escape
liability for the debts contracted by her former husband,
was also followed in the Colonies.</p>

<p>This notion that a bride who lacked modesty, as well
as money could throw off her debts with her dress, by
going to church in her smock or under garment and
thus let her creditors “shift” for themselves, finds
many examples in the English cases during the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries.</p>

<p>On October 17, 1714, Anne Sellwood, of Chilters, All
Saints, Wiltshire and John Bridmore, were united in
the holy bonds of matrimony and against the record in
the parish register occurs the memorandum: “The
aforesaid Anne Sellwood was married in her shift,
without any clothes or head-gear on.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>In 1766 a Whitehaven bride also sought to attain the
same end, by going to church, as became any decent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
woman, undressing herself to her sole under-garment
for the ceremony and donning her clothes again as
soon as the knot was tied.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> And it is recorded that
somewhere between the years 1838 and 1844, a Lincolnshire
curate officiated at a wedding where the bride
stood before him, enveloped only in a sheet.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>While such attempts evidence a perhaps dishonest
effort to evade the law of debtor and creditor, these
“smock-marriages” nevertheless evince a most laudable
inclination on the part of such bold brides to save
the purse of their intended husbands, so while modern
husbands would not appreciate the entire return to this
now obsolete custom, they would not object to the effort
of brides, while decently clad, in emulation of the
spirit evinced by these ancient dames of the “shift marriage”
period, of using their best efforts to spare the
pocket-books of the men of their choice.</p>

<p>Alice Morse Earle, in her interesting volume, “Customs
in old New England,” refers to a “smock-marriage”
at Westerly, Rhode Island.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The traveler Kalm also describes such a marriage in
Pennsylvania, in 1748, where the bridegroom, with the
proper spirit of chivalry, in order to save the appearance
of his bride and also his credit, met the bride in
her scant drapery, half way between her house and his
own, well provided with warm garments which he
dressed her in, after formally announcing, in the presence
of the assembled guests, that the wedding clothes
which he placed upon her belonged to him and were only
loaned to the bride, especially for the occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>John Gatchell married Sarah Cloutman, while she
was clad only in her “shift,” or “smock,” in Lincoln
County, Maine, in 1767,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and in accordance with the
popular opinion that the creditors of the bride’s first
husband could not follow her farther than the king’s
highway, if she was married only in her “shift,” many
“smock-marriages” occurred at York, Maine, as recorded
in the early history of Wells and Kennebunkport.
The wedding of the Widow Mary Bradley occurred
while she was clad only in her “shift,” or under-garment,
during the cold weather in the month of
February, 1774; she went to meet the bridegroom, thus
thinly clad and the minister found her with chattering
teeth and shivering from the cold. Her groom had not
been as thoughtful as the Pennsylvania bridegroom, in
loaning her clothing for the occasion, so the gallant
gentleman of the cloth kindly threw his cloak around
the freezing bride, to protect her from the wintry
blasts.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>In Hall’s “History of Eastern Vermont,” there is
a graphic account of the marriage of the Widow Lovejoy
to Asa Averill. The widow was not even clad in
her “shift,” or under-garment, but appeared at the
ceremony, in a nude condition, hidden behind a curtain,
in a recess of the chimney.</p>

<p>Mr. William C. Prime, in his interesting book,
“Along New England Roads,” gives an account of two
such marriages that came under his observation. He describes
how the widow Hannah Ward, of Newfane, Vermont,
was married to Major Moses Joy, in 1789, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
the bride, perfectly nude, stood in a closet. She held
her hand out of a diamond shaped hole in the closet
door to Joy, and the ceremony was thus performed, in
the absence even of “smock or shift.”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Immediately
after the ceremony, however, she appeared resplendent
in her wedding garments, which the gallant Major had
provided for her, in the closet.</p>

<p>In the other marriage, according to this old custom,
as described by Mr. Prime, the nude bride left her room
by a window, at night and standing on the top rung of a
high ladder, she donned her wedding garments and thus
abandoned the old obligations of her widowhood.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>One of the most curious variations of this custom,
however, is the account given, by Gustavus Vassa, of a
“smock-marriage” which occurred on the gallows, in
New York, in 1784. A felon who had been sentenced to
death was about to be hanged, when he was liberated to
wed a woman clad only in her “shift.”<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>This strange belief in gallows matches, that a condemned
felon could be thus rescued, by marriage to
any woman who would take him from the gallows, is
placed by Barrington in the list of legal vulgar errors.
But, as suggested by a writer in Chambers Journal,
under the subject “Matrimonial Curiosities,” it seems
doubtful if such a queer idea could have taken possession
of the popular mind, unless there was some foundation
for it, in the law.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> It is perhaps but one of many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
such customs, arising from some isolated case, wherein
the Court recognized it, which gave it currency and
caused it to be followed in other instances.</p>

<p>We are told that in 1725 a woman petitioned King
George I., for the pardon of a convicted felon, in order
that she might wed him, under Tyburn Tree.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Manningham states that this was the custom, not the
law, in olden times, in France, and Italy, and that if any
notorious strumpet would beg a convicted felon, about
to be hanged for her husband, her plea would be
granted, in order that their joint lives might be bettered
by so holy an action.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Sterill reports a case that he had seen wherein a
woman, clad only in her smock, or under-garment,
begged a condemned person for her husband, with a
white wand in her hand.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Whatever recognition the law gave this custom, that
it actually existed in England, and France is evidenced
by the many references to the practice, in story and
rhyme, published during the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries.</p>

<p>Montaigne tells a story of a Picardian, who, seeing a
lame dame advancing toward him, cried out: “She
limps, she limps, despatch me quickly.”<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The ballads
of Roxburghe also tell, in rhyme, how a merchant of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Chichester, who had killed a German, after his sentence
and last speech upon the gallows, was wooed by no less
than ten goodly maidens, who thus addressed him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“This is our law,” quoth they;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“We may your death remove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If you, in lieu of our good-will,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will grant to us your love.”<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But having left the fixed doctrines of the law governing
the relation between the opposite sexes, known as
marriage, to enter into a study and analysis of the vulgar
errors in connection with this subject-matter, it is
high time to bring the chapter to a close.</p>

<p>Of course it was only attempted in this chapter to
take a most cursory view of the great subject selected
and to present but a few of the many laws and customs
that have sprung up among the various peoples of the
earth, governing the relation whereby the opposite
sexes, in accordance with the law of natural selection,
appropriate themselves to one another.</p>

<p>In the ultimate days, when human multiplication has
done its work—when man has become so populous that
every square foot of ground upon the known earth shall
be covered by a man—the law of evolution will no doubt
have eradicated many of the present marriage laws and
customs, based upon a false public opinion, and the
generation of the species will no doubt be conducted
along more advanced and scientific lines.</p>

<p>For the next few centuries, however, judging the
future by the past, the marriage relation will continue
in the same crude and unscientific condition that has
controled it for the past five thousand years, so we need<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
not now concern ourselves about any “devastating torrent”
of children, but leave this vexed problem for
succeeding centuries.</p>

<p>In the meantime, like visionary things, mere motes,
the atoms known as human beings, will continue to be
brought into the world, as a result of the unnatural
laws and customs governing this natural relation,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Still wondering how the marvel came, because two coupling mammals chose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To slake the thirst of fleshy love.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tossed into the “giant grasp of Life, like gale-borne
dust, or wind-wrung spray,” the son of man will continue
to be “the toy, the sport, the waif and stray of
passions, error, wrath and fear.”</p>

<p>Empires have perished and nations have risen during
the period covered by the foregoing pages. Countless
millions of human beings have lived their little
lives, with their tincture of lust; tasted, for a brief
space, the “joy in an armful of beautiful dust,” as a
result of the relation established by the laws and customs
treated of in these pages, and then “step by step,
perforce, returned” to “couthless youth, wan, white
and cold, Lisping again the broken words, till all the
tale be fully told.” And thus, for successive ages to
come, will the “moving row of magic shadow shapes,”
continue to come and go “Round with the sun-illumined-lantern
held, in Midnight, by the Master of the
Show.”</p>

<p>E. J. Woods in his book, “The Wedding Day in All Ages and
Countries,” claims that the old Hebrew expression of “taking a
wife,” arose from the custom of capture, not common to the Israelites,
but common to other primitive peoples. (Vol. I., p. 9.) He
quotes Plutarch, as authority for the custom of the Spartans to
carry off their brides by capture. (Vol. I., pp. 40, 41.) Refers to
the Rape of the Sabines (vol. I., p. 52), the “Institutes” of Menu,
as providing one of the forms of marriage by capture, known to
the four classes of India (vol. I., p. 124). He claims that “the
capture of women prevailed among the aborigines of the Dekkan
and in Afghanistan.” (Vol. I., p. 137) He maintains that “In New
Zealand and the Fejee and other islands of the Pacific, the custom
of capture of women for wives has prevailed from the earliest times
of the known history of those places.” (Vol. I., p. 191.) “The form
of capture is observed in the marriages of the Kalmucks, the Nogay
Tartars, the Mongols, of the Ortous, in Tartary, the Circassians
and the people generally of the Caucasus.” (Vol. I., p. 210.) He
claims that marriage by capture obtained in Poland, in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries (vol. I., p. 220), that the seizure
of wives by force obtained in Ireland (vol. II., p. 50), so if this
record is true, since this custom is found to obtain in these countries
so late as recent historical dates, it is not unbelievable that capture
was the order of the early barbarous days in our own and other
countries.</p>

<p>Before the end of the Republic, the <i>confarreatio</i> had practically
become obsolete and was regarded as an old world curiosity, although
formerly obtaining generally, in all patrician families. (III.
Essays in Anglo-American Legal History, p. 789.) The religious
ceremony, used at the marriage <i>confarreatio</i>, is described in Wood’s
“Wedding Day in All Ages and Countries,” where it is shown that
the custom of the “bride-cake” is directly traceable to the cake of
wheat or barley, used at this old religious ceremony. (“Wedding

<p>The law did not give the marriage any retroactive effect, by
reason of this custom of throwing a mantle over the children born
prior to wedlock, but the custom was recognized by the law, to the
effect of legitimating the children, in the sense that the act of
adopting the custom was equivalent to a legal adoption of the
children, and in spreading the cloak over the children, the law was
willing to also spread its protecting “mantle” over them and thus
they became “mantle children,” by force of both the law and this
old custom of adoption. Although followed in Germany, France
and Normandy, this custom was refused judicial recognition in the
reign of Henry II. and Henry III. See Pollock and Maitland’s History
English Law, p. 398. But for illustrations of the application of the
custom in the countries above named, see Schroder’s “Mantel-Kinder”
of Germany, D. R. G. 712.</p>

<p>Discussing the subject of “mantle-children,” in his work “Wedding
Day in All Ages,” Wood says: “According to the Scotch law,
the marriage of the father and mother legitimatizes all children
previously born, however old they may be. An old saying is that
‘all children under the mother’s girdle or apron-string’ at the time
of the marriage, are legitimate. In very early days children born
before wedlock used to perform a part in the marriage ceremony,
by being placed under the veil or mantle of the bride or the pallium
of the altar, in which position, they received the nuptial benediction.
And instances have occurred in more modern times, where premature
offspring have been put under their mother’s apron, and had the
string tied over them during her marriage.” (Vol. II., pp. 74, 75.)</p>

<p>The statute of the 26’ year of George II., enacted that wedding
banns should be regularly published three successive Sundays in the
church of the parish where the parties were for the time residing.
This statute was passed to prevent the evils of the “Fleet marriages,”
during the year 1616, when the Rector of St. James was suspended
and clerical men living within the Rules of the Fleet, solicited
passers-by for patronage and celebrated marriage ceremonies in
ale-houses and garrets, without the publication of banns, or the existence
of marriage licenses. Wood’s “Wedding Day in All Ages,” vol.

<p>The custom of purchasing wives was known to the ancient Greeks
and was strongly opposed by Aristotle. The payment of money was
frequently the only form of marriage, in ancient Greece. (Wood’s
“Wedding Day in All Ages and Countries,” vol. I., pp. 33, 47, 51.)</p>

<p>In Syria every man paid a sum for his wife, proportionate to
the rank of her father. (<i>Ante. idem.</i>, p. 72.)</p>

<p>The Arabians bought their wives as they did their slaves. (<i>Ante

<p>Burckhardt says that among the Bedouins, of Mount Sinai, marriage
is a mere matter of purchase and sale. (<i>Ante idem.</i>, p. 85.)</p>

<p>And the same custom obtained among the Mohammedans, Javanese,
Ethiopians, Circassians, Ostiacs, a Tarter tribe, Laplanders, the
ancient Germans, Romans and French, as well as our early Saxon
ancestors. (Wood’s “Wedding Day in All Ages and Countries,” vol.
I., pp. 90, 155, 174, 210, 214, and vol. II., pp. 3, 173, 247.)</p>

<p>The custom of purchasing wives is perhaps derived from the old
Salic law. It was known to the ancient Jews, as well as the other
nations above mentioned and the custom of marriage portions and
doweries is no doubt the outgrowth of this old practice. (Wood’s
“Wedding Day in All Ages and Countries,” vol. II., p. 173.)</p>

In legal contemplation, a female was in the custody of the Lord
paramount, until she reached her majority, and then he was bound
to find her a proper marriage. His custody continued until her
marriage, even after she became of age and she could only marry
with his consent. She was bound to obtain the consent of the Lord,
or lose her dower, but it was sufficient, if she had the consent of
the chief lord, to marry. The custom was based upon the fealty
which the husband owed the lord and since the woman lost her
inheritance, if she gave cause of forfeiture, the lord had it in his
power to exact anything of her, and hence the custom referred to
in the text, an exaction allowed by way of a punishment for the
offense of belonging to the frail sex, in an early day. Reeve’s History
English Law, vol. I., pp. 370, 371.</p>

<p>Shakespeare makes Cade refer to this old barbarous custom, in

<p>Shakespeare makes frequent reference to the marriage custom of
giving a dowry to the bride, in his various plays. Thus, in “Love’s
Labour’s Lost,” (Act II., Scene I), Boyet, in speaking to the Princess,
refers to Aquitaine as “a dowry for a queen;” King John tells Phillip
of France, that if his son shall love his daughter, “Her dowry shall
weigh equal with a queen.” (King John, Act II., Scene I.) Petruchio
tells Katherine, in “Taming of the Shrew”: “<i>Pet.</i> Your father
hath consented that you shall be my wife; your dowry ’greed on;
and will you, nil you, I will marry you.” (Act II., Scene I.) Gloster, in
1’ Henry VI., speaking of the proffer of his daughter to the King,
by the Earl of Armagnac, refers to the “large and sumptuous dowry.”
(Act V., Scene I.) And the poor Lear, is made to ask the duke
of Burgundy, in discarding his daughter, Cordelia: “What, in the
least, will you require in present dower with her?” (Act I., Scene
I.)</p>

<p>The custom of placing the ring upon the fourth finger of the left
hand, according to the opinion of a writer in the British Apollo, in
1708, dates from the discovery of the convenience of the left hand
for such ornament because less employed than the right and the
fourth finger, less than others, was needed in ordinary use. See

<p>Discussing the subject of “gallows-matches,” Wood, in his “Wedding
Day in All Ages,” says: “Formerly was current a vulgar notion
that if a woman married a condemned man under the gallows, she
would thereby save him from execution. Certainly this exemption
had a quasi-legal existence in France in the fifteenth century, as
there are instances of it in the annals of that country.” (Vol. 2,
p. 25.)</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br>
<span class="smcap">Witchcraft and Sorcery.</span></h2>

</div>

<p><i>Witch</i>, is taken from the Hebrew word, rendered
<i>venefica</i>, meaning a poisoner and divineress; one who
dabbles in spells and fortune-telling.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In course of
time, the term was used to indicate those who held communion
with evil spirits and derived a super-human
power from them, whereby they could not only foretell
the coming of future events, but bring about evil results
upon the life, bodies, or possessions of individuals.
This unnatural power was supposed to be acquired by
a compact with the devil himself, by which the wizard
or witch bargained his or her soul to the devil as a consideration
for the power of enchantment.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>From the earliest times, men and women have tried to
hold communion with superior beings and to pierce the
secrets of the future.</p>

<p>In the oldest code of laws in the known world, promulgated
by Hammurabi, King of Babylon, 2285 years
before Christ, the first two sections of the code are
levelled at the crime of witchcraft, and we find that it is
there written, that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If a man weave a spell and put a ban upon a man,
and has not justified himself, he that wove the spell
upon him shall be put to death.”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>And the same code provided that the man against
whom the spell was woven, should plunge into the “holy
river” and if the river overcame him, his house should
go to the weaver of the spell, but if the river made the
man innocent, he should take the house of the sorcerer
and he was to be put to death.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>According to the photogravure of the blocks of diorite,
upon which these most antique laws were written,
therefore, when King Hammurabi, received his law
direct from the seated sun-god, Samas,—the judge of
heaven and earth—the old delusion of witchcraft and
sorcery obtained. So prevalent was the offense, according
to the delusion then obtaining, that the very first
sections of the code were directed at this crime, established
to the satisfaction of the judges of that period, by
the test of a plunge into the “holy river,” in the absence
of more direct proof of the existence of the offense
which existed only in the imaginations of the superstitious
inhabitants of that misty age.</p>

<p>During the time of Moses, we find that many imposters
insulted the intelligence of the Supreme Being,
by claiming to have received delegated powers from on
high and hence Moses provided in his law that “Thou
shalt not suffer a witch to live.” The long persecution
of persons convicted of witchcraft, by a misinterpretation
of this text, was thus justified by this Biblical injunction
and many conscientious men and women, in
their inability to understand the science of common
things, attributed appearances which they could not
explain, to supernatural agencies and blindly believing
in this Mosaic law, proceeded to violate the highest laws<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
of God and man, in the fanaticism that a Divine injunction
was being obeyed, in the punishment of those convicted
of witchcraft and sorcery.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The Twelve Tables of the early Romans contained
penal provisions against one who should bewitch the
fruits of the earth or conjure away his neighbors’ corn,
into his own field,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and a century and a half after the
adoption of the Twelve Tables, one hundred and seventy
Roman women were tried and convicted of poisoning,
under the pretense of charms and incantations, which
led to new laws against such supposed practices.</p>

<p>As the Mosaic law against witchcraft was formerly
interpreted, to mean the punishment by death of witches
who did positive injury to another in his person or
property, so the Roman laws were directed against
those supposed to have done positive injury to a person,
in his property or to have hurt him, physically.</p>

<p>In other words, the mere possession of magic art, in
the old heathen world, was not, in itself a crime, for
while it was dreaded, as being liable to be turned to
malicious or wrongful purposes, it was also recognized
as a most beneficial art, through which the religion of
domestic life and the remedy of healing the sick, was
supposed to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>That this view of witchcraft continued to prevail for
many centuries after the reception of Christianity, is
evidenced by the laws of Constantine, in the fourth
century, which ordained capital punishment for all
those who practiced noxious charms against the life or
health of others, by supernatural power, but exempted
from the punishment of the law, all those who practiced
magical arts for beneficial purposes, such as warding
off hailstorms, and excessive rains or windstorms, or
curing cattle or persons afflicted with disease.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The savage laws by the Christian Emperors in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
early centuries did considerable harm in after ages.
The Anglo-Saxons patterned their laws against sorcery
and witchcraft after the folk-laws of the continent and
Cnut, even, legislated against the witchcraft which was
heathenish.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Henry I., criminals who encompassed
the maiming or sickening of a person by maltreating
a waxen image of him—a belief that generally
obtained from this time until the seventeenth century—were
either hanged or burnt.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And during the reign of
this monarch, in England, Archbishop Gerard, of York,
was accused of necromancy and sorcery and when it
was discovered that he had died suddenly, and a book
on the subject of astrology was found under his pillow,
his body was refused burial in the Cathedral.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>After the influence of the Catholic religion had safely
extended its power over the western world, however,
and the fear of a return to paganism was looked upon as
most improbable, the church was not inclined to look
with such aversion upon the class of criminals accused
of dabbling in the black arts. Astrology and necromancy
were looked upon with considerable admiration
by the most powerful of the church and laity and even
Bishops and Popes tempted the powers of evil, by little
harmless excursions into the great realm of the supernatural.</p>

<p>This temporizing by the church continued until about
the beginning of the thirteenth century, when heresy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
had become so common that the interests of the church
were threatened and when the church began, in various
parts of the world, a most stringent prosecution of
witches and sorcerers and the crowned-heads of Europe,
in humble submission to the demands of the Pope, used
the power of the kingdom in an attempt to rid the
church of this threatened evil.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>From an early day, in France, people were punished
for supposed crimes resulting from witchcraft and sorcery.
Charlemagne frequently ordered all necromancers,
sorcerers and witches to be driven from the realm
and with the gradual increase of the crimes attributed
to them, he published different edicts, preserved at
length in the “Capitulaire de Baluse.”<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>By these edicts, death was decreed against all those
who practiced feats of sorcery and witchcraft, and those
who conspired with the devil to afflict either man or
woman, with barrenness; who excited tempests, or
windstorms; destroyed the fruits of the earth, hurt
cows, or other animals, and afflicted human beings
with sores or disease, were to be immediately executed,
upon their conviction.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>From the time of Charlemagne until the eighteenth
century, in France, England, Scotland and other European
countries, the trials for witchcraft and sorcery continuously
multiplied and it became the common means
to enable a wolfish monarch to rid himself of a disliked
rival or subject, upon some trumped-up charge, based
upon some trivial circumstance connected with an unexplained
phenomenon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>The destruction of the Stedinger, in 1234; the persecutions
of the Templars, from 1307 to the year 1313;
the trial and execution of poor Joan of Arc, in 1429, the
tragedy of Arras, in 1459, and many other horrible casualties,
during the middle ages illustrate the prevalency
with which this delusion was used to bring about the
death and destruction of a large portion of the human
race, who were guilty only of living in an age of ignorance
and cruelty.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>At the instance of Pope Gregory IX., the Emperor of
Germany, Frederic II., pronounced his banns against
the valiant Stedinger, in 1233 and a crusade was inaugurated
against them in all Germany. Eight thousand of
them were slain upon the field of battle and the whole
race extinguished and their houses and woods were
burned, because they would not embrace the Catholic
religion, but continued to adhere to their own ideals
and ideas in religion and government. The Pope
charged that they “insulted the holy sacrament, consulted
witches to raise evil spirits, shed blood like
water, took the lives of priests and concocted an infernal
scheme to propagate the worship of the devil.”<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>The Templars had also offended the Church and in
1307 the charge was brought against them that they
were in communion with evil spirits and had sold their
souls to the devil. This charge effected its object and
they were extirpated, even as the poor Stedinger had
been, in the previous century.</p>

<p>Philip IV., of France, acting under authority of the
Pope, ordered the arrest and trial of the Templars and
the confiscation of their goods and property. Hundreds
were put to the rack and when tortured by pain, confessed
the most unreasonable charges which were
lodged against them and this only heightened the popular
clamor and the persecution against them, as a body.
Fifty-nine Templars were burned alive, by a slow
fire, in a field adjoining the city of Paris, after they
had been convicted of witchcraft and sorcery, and other
instances of their persecutions, upon this charge, occurred
in the different provinces, until the year 1313,
when the Grand Master of the Order Jacques de Molay
was burned to death, a fitting climax to this reign of
terror, inaugurated by the Pope and Monarch, to rid
themselves of an odious order—a lasting stigma to the
memory of the Pope and Monarch responsible for such
conditions and an ever increasing source of pity to the
millions possessing the divine gift of a tender fellow-feeling
for their own kind.</p>

<p>In 1429 the poor Joan of Arc fell a victim to the
charge of witchcraft and sorcery and like dual criminals,
proceeding hand in hand to accomplish the crime,
religion and law, not only failed to raise a hand to prevent
the conflagration that consumed and tortured the
sainted body of this patriotic victim, but actually consummated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
the crime, in the name of holy order and
legal procedure, which will remain eternally as one of
the saddest and most pitiable spectacles of the weakness
and criminal blunderings of the Church and State.</p>

<p>In 1459 a devoted congregation of the Waldenses, at
Arras, fell victims to a charge of witchcraft and sorcery.
Many of them, when placed upon the rack, admitted
their guilt, to escape the torture; prominent
rulers and people of wealth were involved and many
were burned, while others were thrown in prison, or
paid large fines to escape a worse fate, at the hands of
the ignorant and intolerant courts, that reflected the
hatred and persecution of the enraged populace.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>In 1487 two old women were arrested for witchcraft,
in Switzerland, for having caused a tempest.
They were placed upon the rack, where people, enforc’d
do speak anything, and after severe torture they admitted
that they were in collusion with the devil and
were condemned to die, and if the criminal register at
Constance is to be believed, they were burned at the
stake, for after the name of each, appears the significant
epitaph: “<i>convicta et combusta</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Speaking of the great prevalency of this accusation,
about this period, Florimond, in his work concerning
the Anti-Christ, observes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The seats destined for criminals in our courts of
justice are blackened with persons accused of this guilt.
There are not judges enough to try them. Our dungeons
are gorged with them. No day passes that we do not
render our tribunals bloody by the dooms which we
pronounce, or in which we do not return to our homes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
discountenanced and terrified at the horrible confessions
we have heard.”</p>

</div>

<p>But the <i>Witch Mania</i> in Europe, may be said to properly
date from about the year 1488, when Pope Innocent
VIII., in a determined effort to rid the Church of Rome
of the stigma and opposition of those supposed to be
prompted by the devil, appointed inquisitors in every
country, armed with the apostolic power to accuse and
punish this class of criminals.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Following the appointment of this commission and
those of successive Popes, a wholesale slaughter of innocent
men and women, followed this crusade of bigotry
and ignorance.</p>

<p>Cumanus burned forty-one women in one province
alone, in Italy; Sprenger burned more than five hundred
in a year, in Germany; five hundred were burned in
Geneva, in 1515 and 1516; in the district of Como, in
the year 1524 about a thousand people suffered death
for witchcraft and for several years thereafter the
general average in this district was a hundred a year
and one inquisitor alone, Remigius, took whatever credit
he was entitled to, for having during a period of fifteen
years convicted and burned nine hundred poor souls
for this imaginary offense.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>In 1520 witches were burned in fires that were ever
kept burning to receive their tortured bodies, in France.
In 1561 five poor women of Verneuil were convicted of
turning themselves into cats and prowling around and
performing satanic feats, as a result of which they were
all burned alive.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>In 1571 the celebrated sorcerer, Trais Echelles, after
his confession, was burned at the Place de Greve, in
Paris.</p>

<p>In 1573 Giles Garnier, of Lyons, was indicted for
being a loup-garou, or man wolf,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and prowling around
at night and destroying children. Fifty witnesses testified
against him and after being placed upon the rack,
he confessed the crime he was charged with and was
condemned by Dr. Camus to be:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“tied to a stake and burned alive and that his ashes
be then scattered to the winds.”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The conditions in England, during the sixteenth
century, were about the same as in France, Germany
and Italy, so far as the persecutions for witchcraft were
concerned. While rooting out many errors of ignorance
and superstition, the Reformation made no head-way
at all against witchcraft and sorcery, the greatest evil
of the period and strange to narrate, while their followers
were persecuted for this crime, Luther and Calvin
were as firm believers in witchcraft as were the
Popes whom they opposed and their followers were
even as zealous persecutors of the innocents accused
of this crime as were the churchmen of the old religion.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>A few of the English cases will not be found uninstructive
as illustrative of the prejudice and persecution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
levelled at those accused of witchcraft in that
country, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p>The celebrated case of the Witches of Warbois, in
1594, is especially worthy of mention. The good old
Mother Samuel lived in the neighborhood of Sir Samuel
Cromwell and a Mr. Throgmorton and the latter had
several daughters and among them a Miss Joan, who
was a melancholy girl, whose head was filled with
stories of ghosts and witches and she conceived the idea
that poor old Mother Samuel had bewitched her, as
she felt sudden pains in her limbs and strange sensations,
when she went near her. Her parents believed her
and after a few family casualties the poor old woman
was arrested upon a charge of witchcraft filed against
her by the family of Sir Samuel Cromwell, after the
death of his wife, as she had confessed, upon different
persecutions that she had afflicted them with pains and
fits and turned their milk sour in the pans, prevented
their ewes and cows from bearing and that she had
caused Lady Cromwell’s death. She also confessed
that her husband and daughter were leagued with her
in witchcraft and all three were found guilty and
hanged on April 7’, 1593.</p>

<p>In Scotland, during the ninth Parliament of Queen
Mary, witchcraft was made a crime punishable by
death, and after this statute, the superstition and fear
of the people brought frequent accusations against different
people, many of whom were prominent in Government
and social circles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>The case against Dr. Fian and his accomplices will
illustrate the feeling obtaining in Scotland about this
period. Gellie Duncan implicated Agnes Sampson and
when she was put to the torture, she also implicated
Dr. Fian, Marion Lincup and Euphemia Macalzean,
the daughter of Lord Cliftonhall. They were charged
with having attempted the king’s life, through witchcraft
and sorcery. It was charged that they had raised
a fearful storm at sea, to attempt to wreck a ship on
which the king, James VI., and his bride had sailed.
Several of the accused were subjected to the torture
and finally confessed to the crime and implicated the
rest, and on June 25’, 1591, Barbara Napier, Gellie
Duncan, Agnes Sampson, Dr. Fian and twenty-five
others were hanged for witchcraft and Euphemia Macalzean
was “bound to a stake, and burned in ashes,
<i>quick</i> to the death.”<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>After this conviction in Scotland, the renown of King
James as an enemy to witchcraft and sorcery, preceded
him to England and when he ascended the English
throne in 1603, he was ready for a new crusade against
this obnoxious class of criminals.</p>

<p>The first statute upon witchcraft, in England, was
that of 1541, which defined the offense and affixed the
punishment.</p>

<p>Two statutes were passed in 1551, one relating to
false prophesies, due no doubt to the machinations of
Elizabeth Barton, the “Holy Maid of Kent,” and the
other was levelled at conjurgations, witchcraft and
sorcery.</p>

<p>The statute of Elizabeth, in 1562, recognized witchcraft<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
as a crime of first magnitude, punishable by death,
regardless of whether it was exerted against the lives,
limbs, or property of the subjects.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>On his accession to the throne in 1604 King James
passed the statute whereby it was enacted that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If any person shall use, practice, or exercise, any
conjurgation of any wicked or evil spirit, or shall consult,
covenant with, or feed any such spirit, the first
offense to be imprisoned for a year and stand in the
pillory once a quarter; the second offense to be death.”</p>

</div>

<p>The milder punishment was not inflicted, but all convicted
under this statute were hanged and burned, or
burned, without previous strangling, “alive and quick.”</p>

<p>This statute continued on the statute books until the
year 1736, when it was repealed and suffered no longer
to disgrace the intelligence of the country, after which
date witches, conjurers and fortune-tellers were only
subjected to the jail sentences common to other misdemeanors,
confinement for short intervals, or the pillory.</p>

<p>We are reliably informed that during the Long Parliament,
in England, three thousand witches were executed<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
and during the first eighty years of the seventeenth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
century, it has been estimated that five hundred
people were annually executed for witchcraft, in England,
making a total of forty thousand who thus met
their deaths, during the whole period referred to.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>One of the rankest weeds in the garden of wild delusions
that flourished in England, in the seventeenth
century was Matthew Hopkins, who prided himself
upon the title of “Witch-finder General.” About 1644
he made the discovery of some moles or other marks on
the accused persons, which he advertised as “devil’s
marks” and he immediately became in great demand
in helping to hunt down and convict persons accused
of this crime.</p>

<p>He had several tests to subject them to, and one of
the cruelest was to tie the hands and feet of the prisoner
together cross-wise, the right thumb to the toe of the
left foot and <i>vice versa</i>. Being thus tied, so they could
not swim, they were wrapped in a cloth or blanket and
placed in a pool of water or a river, on their backs. If
they sank, they were innocent, but drowned for their
innocence, and if they floated, they were adjudged guilty
of witchcraft and hanged or burned.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Another kind of punishment, to extort a confession,
was what was called “Waking” the witch. An iron
bridle or hoop was placed cross-wise of her face with
four prongs, penetrating the mouth. The hoop was
fastened to the wall at the back of the head, so that
the prisoner could not lie down. She was kept in this
position sometimes for several days, attendants constantly
prodding her, to keep her awake.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>In 1664 the venerable Sir Mathew Hale, condemned
Amy Duny and Rose Cullender, to be burned at the
stake in St. Edmondsbury, upon the most flimsy kind
of proof, offered to establish this imaginary crime.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>When these two old women went to a shop to purchase
herring, their ugliness caused them to be insulted,
and they resented it. The daughter of the owner of the
store was afflicted with epilepsy and the women were
charged with having bewitched her. She was blind-folded
and when they touched her, her imagination and
nervousness was such that she was thrown into a fit
and this was received as proof positive of her bewitchment
and the fact that she also was thrown into a fit,
when similarly blind-folded, when others than the accused
persons touched her, was held incompetent as
evidence in their favor.</p>

<p>Upon the evidence of Samuel Pacey, the girl’s father,
Margaret Arnold, her aunt, and Thomas Brown, as an
expert witness upon Witchcraft, the learned Sir
Mathew Hale charged the jury to ascertain from the
evidence, first, whether or not the persons charged were
actually bewitched and if so, whether or not the prisoners
had actually bewitched her. He personally told
the jury that he had no doubt of the fact that witches
existed, first because the Scriptures affirmed it and,
secondly, because the laws of the country recognized
it. The jury promptly returned a verdict of guilty and
the girl and her father called the next morning to see
Sir Mathew Hale and advised him that the complete
recovery of the girl followed within a half hour after
the verdict of conviction against the prisoners.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>Eleven cases of witchcraft were tried before Chief-Justice
Holt, between 1694 and 1701, but sentiment
was changing toward this offense, by this time and this
rugged and astute lawyer made such an appeal to the
jury, in each case, that all the defendants were acquitted.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Jane Wenham, known as the “Witch of Walkerne,”
was tried and convicted before Lord Chief-Justice
Powell, in 1711, upon the most fanciful and ridiculous
kind of evidence, but she was pardoned, before her execution.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>In 1716, however, a woman and her daughter only
nine years old, were tried and convicted of sorcery, at
Huntingdon, because they had washed their stockings
and made a lather of soap and raised a storm and for
this terrible offense they were both hanged.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>But this was the last judicial execution for witchcraft
in England, although many prisoners were
charged with the crime, between this date and the year
1736, when the statute of James I. was repealed.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>While the delirium of witchcraft was raging in Europe,—until
its victims numbered tens of thousands
and its votaries millions,—the fever spread across
the ocean and the New England colonists also fell a
prey to the superstition. The fear of witchcraft and
sorcery seized the multitudes in the United States, in
the middle of the seventeenth century and supposed
criminals were arrested in such numbers that the
prisons were not large enough to hold them.</p>

<p>The persecutions at Salem, Massachusetts, lasted
from February until September, 1692, during which
time, nineteen supposed witches were hung, fourteen
of them being women.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Under the early statutes of New York and Pennsylvania,
witchcraft was a capital offense.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The good William Penn, who fled from similar persecution
in England, presided in the “City of Brotherly
Love,” at the trial of two Swedish women, who were
arraigned for witchcraft. The funeral pile had been
prepared and the flint and tinder were all ready to burn
them, but fortunately they were acquitted of the
charge.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>In Connecticut and Massachusetts, the penalty for
witchcraft was death and the laws of these states were
based not only upon the Mosaic code, but upon the
Common Law of England, as well.</p>

<p>A few trials occurred in Virginia and Maryland and
six persons were hung, in Connecticut, for witchcraft,
during the last half of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Margaret Jones was executed for witchcraft, in Boston,
in June, 1648; Mary Parsons, of Springfield, Massachusetts,
was tried and convicted, in 1651; Mrs. Ann
Hibbins was executed in Boston, in 1656, and Goody
Glover was executed at the same place, in 1688.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The history of the persecutions at Salem, Massachusetts,
has furnished the basis for several books, presenting
the harrowing details of the trial of the several
victims of the crusade against the delusion of witchcraft,
at that place.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The Salem persecutions began with the delusions of
a party of young girls, who imagined they were bewitched.
Elizabeth Parris, aged nine, the daughter of
Rev. Samuel Parris, her cousin, Abigail Williams, aged
eleven, Ann Putnam, aged twelve, the daughter of the
parish clerk, Mary Walcott, Mercy Lewis, Elizabeth
Hubbard and several other girls furnished the evidence
upon which these persecutions were begun.</p>

<p>After reading of witchcraft and magic, these children,
who had worked themselves into a state of nervous excitement,
began to cut queer antics, such as hiding in
holes; crawling under chairs; assuming odd postures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
and uttering loud and incoherent expressions, all of
which they attributed to the supernatural power exerted
over them by three women of the neighborhood, Sarah
Good, Sarah Osburn and an Indian woman named Tituba.
Acting under the license of witchcraft, these girls
disturbed religious worship, at will and performed other
little misdemeanors, which their doting parents laid
to the door of the witches, instead of correcting them,
as they should have done.</p>

<p>Finally the three women were arrested and arraigned
for the crime of witchcraft. They were unpopular and
uncomely women, as Mrs. Upham shows, Mrs. Good
having been abandoned by her husband and Mrs. Osburn
being a poor unhappy woman, bed-ridden and suffering
from nervousness and melancholia.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Tituba, the
Indian woman, believed in witchcraft herself and had
told the children stories of evil spirits until they firmly
believed in her unnatural power.</p>

<p>On March 1’, 1692, the trial was begun at the meeting
house in Salem, before Esquires John Hathorn and
Jonathan Corwin. Sarah Good was first examined and
denied any communion with evil spirits and affirmed
her service of God. No counsel was allowed the prisoners,
as this was the custom according to the common
law, in capital cases, unless the Court was in doubt, as
the Judge was supposed to be the counsel for the
prisoner.</p>

<p>After having been tormented for some time, and believing
her escape to lie only in the conviction of someone
else, Mrs. Good accused her co-prisoner, Mrs. Osburn,
and she was remanded to jail and Mrs. Osburn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
was brought before the court. Frail in body and feeble
in her intellect, this poor woman, when interrogated by
the pompous oracles of the law, could only protest her
innocence and deny any communion with evil spirits,
or any knowledge of the offense charged against her
by her alleged accomplice.</p>

<p>After this travesty of a trial, she was again committed
to prison, where she was kept heavily chained,
from March 7, until May 10’, when she died, her innocent
soul being thus forever released from the unnatural
and inhuman affliction heaped upon her body
by her fellow-beings. The Indian woman, when she
was examined, did not deny that the children had been
bewitched, but she laid it all to the door of her co-defendants,
Mrs. Good and Mrs. Osburn.</p>

<p>The girls, when brought before the supposed witches,
fell down and shrieked, in their excitement; if the prisoners
clasped their hands, they screamed that they
were pinched; when they bit their lips, they in turn,
asserted that they were being bitten; they produced
pins, which they said the witches had pricked them
with and worked upon the morbid imagination of the
assembly so that the trials of the witches were little
less than a burlesque.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Martha Corey was arrested on the 19’ of March, 1692,
and the evidence of her husband was used against her,
to the effect that she had taken his saddle to keep him
from attending church; that she sat up late at night
and frequently kneeled on the hearth, as if in prayer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
but uttered no word; that certain of his cattle had been
afflicted and that one of their cats had had a fit. On
such evidence as this, this good woman, was adjudged
guilty and was one of the eight persons executed on
the 22’ of September.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>On April 19’, 1692, when he was over four score
years of age, poor old Giles Corey was arrested for
witchcraft, at Salem, and his case furnishes the only
instance in the United States, where to avoid the attainder
of his blood and the forfeiture of his estate, a
prisoner obstinately stood mute and was “pressed to
death.”</p>

<p>His unfriendly course toward his wife and the attitude
of two of his four sons-in-law in testifying
against his wife, no doubt so worked upon his mind as
to cause him to make a terrible expiation. He deeded
all his property to his two favorite sons-in-law, William
Cleeves and John Moulton, and decided to then stand
mute and refuse to plead and let the law take its course.</p>

<p>Of course he knew that the gates of justice were
closed to him and that he would be convicted, although
he was innocent, but he determined to defy the multitude
and to withhold his plea, in order to save his
property for his sons-in-law and to show his courage,
in the supreme test.</p>

<p>Longfellow, in his “New England Tragedies,” has
described this feeble old man, withstanding the exhortations
of his friends, in his determination to die the
death of a martyr in an unjust cause, and one cannot
read the graphic and realistic account of this tragedy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
without feelings of the greatest compassion and admiration
for this grand old stoic, of our own soil, who
bravely suffered his body to be pressed until all life
was extinct and whose soul took its flight from the open
field, near the Howard street burial ground, in the village
of Salem, on September 19’, 1692.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>In the case of the gentle Rebecca Nurse, even after
her acquittal, by a jury, regularly empaneled and
charged to try her for witchcraft, the frenzied populace
“recalled the decision” and she was sentenced by
the Court, to meet the demands of the mob; she was
carted to the summit of Gallows hill, and hanged, on
July 19’, and her case furnishes one of the most unjust
instances of the “recall of a judicial decision” and one
of the grossest travesties upon justice in the history
of any country.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Because John and Elizabeth Proctor had absented
themselves from the meetings, during the trials for
witchcraft, they were finally accused and thrown in
prison. He made a manly appeal for a trial at Boston,
in a letter dated July 23’, 1692, addressed to Mr. Mather,
Mr. Allen, Mr. Moody, Mr. Willard and Mr. Bailey,
but all to no avail. His friends petitioned the Court;
one of the girls who testified against them made a statement
that she “must have been out of her head,” when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
she gave her evidence, as it was not true, but nothing
could stem the tide of the current of rapidly rising
prejudice and resentment prevailing, so after a farcical
trial, he was convicted and executed on August 19’,
1692.</p>

<p>His fearless defense of his good wife saved her life
and two weeks after his death, she bore a baby in prison
and it was no doubt due to her pregnant condition that
she too, escaped the fury of the mob.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The trials of Bridget Bishop, Mary Easty, a sister
of Rebecca Nurse, the Jacobs family, Martha Carrier
and Philip and Mary English, Elizabeth How, Rev.
George Burroughs, Sarah Wildes, Susanna Martin,
John Williard, Alice Parker, Ann Pudeater, Margaret
Scott, William Reed, Samuel Wardell and Mary
Parker,<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> are all interesting and present the details of
the most stirring tragedies the courts of justice in this
country have ever enacted, but space in this chapter
will not permit the detailed account of these various
trials.</p>

<p>From the earliest times, a great deal has been written
upon the subject of witchcraft and sorcery, in the different
languages of Europe. The delusion has furnished
a theme for long and arduous treatises by
scientist, divine and philosopher and the poet and
novelist, has found it a fruitful source of inspiration
for song and story.</p>

<p>The works of Dr. Joseph Glanvil, chaplain-in-ordinary
to Charles II., and R. Baxter, in his “Certainties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
of the Works of Spirits,” as vindications of the superstitions
of witchcraft and sorcery, did much to spread
the delusion, during the popularity of the superstition.</p>

<p>Balthazar Bekker, a reformed Dutch clergyman, was
the first to strike at the very foundation of the delusion,
near the end of the seventeenth century; Hutchinson, in
his historical essay on Witchcraft, in 1718, also took
a skeptical view of the subject, and these men, with
Weier and Reginald Scot, along with the sturdy advocates
who defended the prisoners charged with witchcraft,
and such judges as Lord Holt, in England, did
much to discourage and overcome the belief in the
fallacy.</p>

<p>Burn’s lines to the “De’il” aptly express the popular
notion of the time when the belief in spooks and
evil spirits obtained:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ae dreary, windy, winter night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The stars shot down wi’ sklentin light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wi’ you, mysel, I got a fright</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Ayont the lough;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye, like a rash-bush, stood in sight</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Wi’ waving sough.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Away ye squatter’d, like a drake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">On whistling wiggs.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The notion of the devil then was that he was a large,
ill-shaped, hairy sprite, with long tail, horns, cloven
feet and wings, as we so often see him pictured in the
old representations.</p>

<p>Before Milton’s time, he was believed to be a mere
mischievous, ugly and petty spirit, who played fantastic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
tricks upon humanity, but Milton made of him the paragon
of evil, not merely grotesque, but a fiend, whose
power was all used for evil.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From the history of Demonology and Witchcraft, as
given in the works of Bodin, Bekker, Leloyer, De
Lancre, Garinet, Mackay, Lecky, Nevins, Upham, Benson,
Goodwin and Sir Walter Scott, demons of both
sexes had existed in the world, ever since the fall of
Adam. They increased and multiplied with wonderful
rapidity; inhabited the air and had no fixed residence
or abode, and when they congregated, windstorms, hurricanes
and earthquakes resulted. They were supposed
to delight in destroying the beauties of nature and
the possessions of man and entered the bodies of individuals
with their breath and caused pains and sickness
and bad dreams. All these demons were at the command
of any person who would barter his soul to them
and his or her evil purpose was then accomplished, but
no good action would be undertaken.</p>

<p>In France and England the witches were supposed
to ride astride broom-sticks, while in Italy and Spain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
the Devil, himself, in the shape of a goat, carried them
on his own back.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>This belief prevailed for many centuries all over Europe
and in certain sections of the world the belief
in witchcraft and sorcery is not entirely eradicated
today.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>In 1627, a ballad entitled the “Druten Zeitung,” or
“Witches Gazette” was quite popular in Germany. The
sufferings of the witches burned at Würzburg, Bamberg,
Franconia and other cities and provinces of the
German Empire, were minutely described, by the poet,
who grew quite witty in his descriptions of the contortions
produced by pain, when the flames brought
forth shrieks from the poor wretches who were burned
alive.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>The “Amber Witch,” by William Meinhold, being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the most interesting trial for witchcraft, of Mary
Schweidler, is one of the most exceptional and interesting
of the books of fiction, based upon the delusion of
witchcraft.</p>

<p>But let us draw the curtain upon this continuous
human tragedy enacted for two and a half centuries, in
Europe, in the name of the law, cataloguing the long
list of judicial murders, upon the stage where superstition
and delusion alone held sway.</p>

<p>It is sad, in the extreme, to contemplate the long list
of human beings whose lives were forfeited, in the early
days of “little knowledge,” by those who thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hoped to merit Heaven, by making earth a Hell.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And it is doubly sad, to contemplate that the Temples
of Justice were peopled by these fears of fantasy and
the imagination—like some of the fetishes that modern
critics of our present judicial system erect in some
places—and that the high priests of the temples blindly
followed the mad cry of the mob and laid aside the
scales of justice to interpret the unjust ideals of an
intoxicated public sentiment, following only the red
flag of murder. These jurists of the past centuries
who participated in this wholesale slaughter of individual
right, may have feared their recall, if they withstood
the frenzy of a wrought-up public clamor, and in
this a lesson can be learned, of the danger of following
the demands of public sentiment, in courts of justice,
instead of the proper ideals of equality and justice.</p>

<p>It is fortunate that only the small percent of the
densely ignorant now-a-days, account for the misunderstood
facts and phenomena of nature by the fears and
delusions of witchcraft and sorcery and that in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
progress of the race, the delusion of witchcraft has
been crowded into the dark, remote and rugged sections
where alone the foot of civilization can find no resting-place.</p>

<p>There are few, if any, more deplorable episodes, in
human history than that of the persecutions for witchcraft.
They illustrate to what an extreme degree of
relentless cruelty human nature will go, when fanned
to a fever-heat of excitement by some fanatical delusion.
On the other hand, the history of the persecutions for
witchcraft show how little reliance can be placed upon
the credibility of witnesses, influenced by some general
excitement, or acting under a mistaken belief of duty,
based upon the attainment of some popular object.
Thousands of witnesses who appeared against the poor
victims charged with this hated crime of witchcraft
and sorcery, honestly believed in the fantastical delusions
and tricks of fancy that they described as actual
occurrences, which in fact had no better foundation than
their own fervid imaginations.</p>

<p>Regarding man’s self, alone, it is difficult to reconcile
the beneficent laws taught by the church, with the
sad “scope and scheme” of things, as disclosed by the
pathetic facts of history, in connection with this subject.
And yet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You cry ‘the cruelty of things’ is mystery to your purblind eye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which fixed upon a point in space, the general project passes by.</div>
    <div class="center">...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dreadest sound man’s ear can hear, the war and rush of stormy wind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Depures the stuff of human life, breeds health and strength for humankind.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thus the race of Being runs, till haply, in the time to be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Earth shifts her pole, and Mushtari men another falling star shall see.”</div>

<p>The “Dialogue on Witches and Witchcraft,” published by the
Percy Society from the literature of the middle ages, presents the
reasons and basis for the belief in Witchcraft, “in which is layed
open how craftily the divell deceiveth not onely the witches, but
many other, and so leadeth them awrie into manie great errours,
By George Giffard, Minister of God’s word, in Malden, published in
1603.”</p>

<p>In this Dialogue, Daniel quotes Christ’s words, as reported by
Marke, that his name is “Legion, for we are many,” as evidence
of the existence of “multitudes and armies of divels, as we see in
the Gospel.” The command of the Mosaic law “Thou shalt not
suffer a witch to live,” is quoted as a sufficient reason for rooting
them out; the words of Moses are quoted that the Lord would cast
out those nations that hearkened unto soothsayers and diviners,
pronouncing that every one that does those things are an abomination
to the Lord; that the Lord not only declared that such as
practiced witchcraft and sorcery were an abomination before the
Lord, but that they should “also bee rooted out.” (Percy Society Pub.
vol. VIII., 24, 40, 42, 52, 72.)</p>

<p>The belief that cats were bewitched to do the bidding of the
devil, which formed such a large part of the delusion of witchcraft,
as practiced in the middle ages, is also touched on, in the “Dialogue
on Witches,” in the above interesting publication, from the literature
of the middle ages which can be read with much amusement
and entertainment, because it gives in realistic hue, a vivid pen
picture of the old delusion, just as it existed in the early days of
the seventeenth century.</p>

Louis XIV., commuted their sentences to banishment for life, when

by 5 Elizabeth, c. 16, that if any person used or practiced witchcraft,
enchantment, charm or sorcery, whereby any one shall happen to be
killed or destroyed, it shall be felony, without clergy. And if anyone
thereby be wasted, consumed, or lamed, in body or member,

<p>While this hideous record of blood and murder, in the name of
the law, was being recorded in England, during the seventeenth
century, a similar record was being written, in the criminal courts
of Spain, Italy, Scotland and Germany. Thousands of innocent
people lost their lives under this charge in these countries, during
this century.</p>

<p>As an illustration of this mad carnival of death, in Würzburg,
alone in the two years following 1627, one hundred and fifty-seven
people were burned, in twenty-nine burnings, averaging from five
to six people at a burning. The wealthy and the paupers, old and
young, the ungainly and the comely, all alike suffered in this unholy
crusade.</p>

<p>Of the list there were three play-actors; four innkeepers; three
councilmen; fourteen vicars; the burgomaster’s lady; an apothecary’s
wife and daughter, the wife, sons and daughter of the councillor
Stolzenberg and Gobel Babelin, “the prettiest girl in the town,”
thirty-two vagrants and a large number of little innocent children,
who were guilty of no offense or crime other than that of living in
a period when their innocence was considered a crime. (Hauber’s
“<i>Acta et Scripta Magica</i>.”)</p>

delusions of the loup-garou, or man wolf, and in the southern portion
of Nigeria, as recently shown by P. Amaury Talbot, superstition
and witchcraft lurk in all the forests and lakes of the country.
Describing these superstitions, in a recent article in the London
Telegraph, Mr. Talbot says:</p>

<p>“The bush with its soft green twilight, dark shadows, and quivering
lights, is peopled by many terrors, but among these ‘Ojje’, or
witchcraft, reigns supreme. The bird which flies in at your open
door in the sunlight, the bat which circles round you at night, the
small bushbeasts which cross your path while hunting, all may be
familiars of witch or wizard or even the latter themselves, disguised
to do you hurt. Sometimes the terror of witchcraft will
scatter a whole town.”</p>

<p>And for belief in witchcraft, among the southern darkies, see
Journal of American Folk Lore, vol. III., p. 205; Bruce’s “Plantation
Negro as a Freeman”; and Jones’ “Negro Myths from the
Georgia Coast.”</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Of all the virtues, Justice is the best,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Valour without it is a common pest.</div>
    <div class="center">...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All other virtues dwell but in the blood,</div>

<p>Judge is the generic descriptive name given to one
who is invested with the power of judging and deciding
causes in the courts of law. The recall, as applied to
the judiciary, is the withdrawal of the power given a
judge to decide causes.</p>

<p>As justice has always been the great interest of man,
on earth, we find that the virtue has ever been extolled,
as one of the greatest blessings of the human race and
among the earliest institutions of which we have any
knowledge, we find that courts were constituted, for
the distribution or enforcement of justice, through the
medium of judges.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>The great law-giver, Moses, having learned the hard
lesson from the book of human life, early grasped the
truth that man’s nature needed protection from its own
impulses and passions, and that an exalted rule of
conduct, commanding what was right, to be effective,
must be enforced and interpreted, by a wholly disinterested
guiding influence. He accordingly established
the administration of justice, among the ancient Israelites,
by choosing “able men, out of Israel, such as
feared God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and
made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands,
rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens;
and they judged the people at all seasons; the hard
causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter
they judged themselves.”<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Grasping, even at this early day at the exalted standard,
later realized, in the Horatian ideal, “of the just
man, who, firm in the consciousness of right, disdains,
with equanimity, the frowns of a tyrant and the clamors
of a mob,” we find this old patriarch, fifteen centuries
before Christ, admonishing the judges of the Israelites:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither
shalt thou speak in a cause, to decline, after many, to
wrest judgment.”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Admonishing the judges, further, in regard to
being swayed in their decisions, by the fickle winds of
public sentiment, Moses said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Ye shall not respect persons in judgment, but ye
shall hear the small as well as the great; <i>ye shall not
be afraid of the face of man</i>; for the judgment is God’s;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me
and I will hear it.”<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And not content with warning the judges of the
danger of fearing the people, in the act of pronouncing
judgment, he also warned the people of the duty of
respecting the judgments of the courts, in the following
wise commands:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And thou shalt come unto the Priests and Levites,
and unto the Judge that shall be in those days and inquire;
and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment.
And thou shalt do according to the sentence,
which they of that place which the Lord shall choose,
shall shew thee; and thou shalt observe to do according
to all that they inform thee. According to the sentence
of the law which they shall teach thee, and according
to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt
do; thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they
shall shew thee to the right hand, nor to the left. And
the man that will do presumptuously, and will not
hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there,
before the Lord thy God, <i>or unto the Judge</i>, even that
man shall die and thou shalt put away the evil from
Israel. And all the people shall hear and fear, and do
no more presumptuously.”<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It thus appears that the ancient Israelites appreciated
the virtue known as Justice and more nearly approximated
the cultivated ideal existing in more recent
times, for they understood, or Moses did, that it was
indispensable, in the act of dispensing justice, for the
incumbent of the judgment seat, to rise superior to the
popular standards of justice and equality and that the
due and orderly realization of the virtue could only be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
realized by a proper regard and respect for the judgments
of the courts when they were pronounced.</p>

<p>In this respect, the old patriarchs were in advance of
the ancient Babylonians and Athenians, for while attempting
the distribution of justice, through the medium
of disinterested judges, they did not seem to
grasp the necessity for an independent judiciary, but
upon unjust grounds they permitted the recall and
debasement of their wisest judges.</p>

<p>In the oldest Code of Laws in the known world, the
code of Hammurabi, King of Babylon, 2285 B. C.,<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> who
claimed to have received his laws from the seated sun-god,
Samas, the “judge of heaven and earth;”—an
old, Mosaic bearded king, as represented to us, from
the dark ages, upon the black block of diorite, presenting
also his Code of Laws; known to history as the
Babylonian king, who conquered the four quarters
of the earth; who enriched Ur (Father Abraham’s
birthplace), the humble, the reverent, who clothed the
gravestones of Malkat with green; the warrior who
guarded Larsa and renewed Ebabbar; the Shield of the
land who united the scattered inhabitants of Isin; who
firmly founded the farm of Kish; the White Potent one
who penetrated the secret cave of the bandits; one who
recognizes the Right and who Rules by Law; who
humbles himself before the great gods<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>—this valiant
one of the misty ages of long ago, in his Code, after
providing for the death of the man who should weave
a spell or put a ban upon another man, in the fifth section<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
of his Code of Laws, provided for the recall or removal
of the judges of his courts, by the following
provision:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If a judge has judged a judgment, decided a decision,
granted a sealed sentence, and afterwards has
altered his judgment, that judge, for the alteration of
the judgment that he judged, one shall put him to account
and he shall pay twelve-fold the penalty, which
was in the said judgment, and in the assembly one
shall expel him from his judgment seat, and he shall
not return, and with the judges at a judgment he shall
not take his seat.”<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Petitions and motions for a rehearing were thus
interdicted by Hammurabi, regardless of the mistakes
entering into the judgment, which could only be righted
by a rehearing, or a new trial, and if a new trial were
granted, the judge was publicly disgraced and recalled
and was never allowed to sit in judgment again.</p>

<p>So unalterably opposed were the ancient Babylonians
to the granting of a new trial, that if a decision for the
infliction of a penalty were set aside, the judge had to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
pay it twelve-fold to him from whom it was exacted and
for any new trial granted by him, the judge was publicly
deposed from his office and expelled from his seat of
judgment and no longer permitted to sit with the
judges. According to the strict letter of the Code, it
was no justification for the judge to be able to show
that the new trial was granted to prevent a miscarriage
of justice, for as the law reads, a judgment once pronounced
was irrevocable, for that judge, at least.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>But let us look more minutely into the procedure,
governing the right of litigants in the days of Hammurabi.
It was the prerogative of the King, during the
First Dynasty, to send to the local judges his own decision
of a cause, or to simply send the case to them
for trial.</p>

<p>Trials were held in the great temple of Ebabbarim,
at Sippara, where copies of his code had been set up
by Hammurabi, at the temple of Merodach in Babylon,
at the temple of Sin, at Larsa, or the temple of Ishhara.
Witnesses, it seems, were sworn, before God and
the King, to swear to the truth, touching the controversy,
and documentary evidence was used, much as
it is today, to establish a right or title by written evidence,
or the agreement of the parties.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Having ascertained
where the right resided, it was the peculiar
province of the judge to “cause them to receive judgment”;
the strife was accordingly quieted and the judgment
passed into an irrevocable decree, which the judge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
himself could not set aside, without thereby working
his own disgrace and recall.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The decision was drawn
up by the scribe and placed upon a tablet, sealed by
the judge and some of these irrevocable tablets, as
imperishable conclusions of these ancient law-suits
have come to us, after thousands of years, to tell their
tale.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>This recipient of the wisdom of the sun-god, Hammurabi,
did not stop with humiliating and degrading
the upright judge, who, to right a wrong judgment
was willing to admit his error to the advantage of a
wronged litigant, by granting a new trial, but in keeping
with such a mistaken standard, the Code of this ancient
ruler of the Babylonians also punished the unsuccessful
surgeon, by removing the hand that performed an
unsuccessful operation;<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> by penalizing the unsuccessful
veterinarian, who lost his neighbor’s cattle or
horse;<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the builder was made liable for all damages
resulting from the fall of a building he had erected<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
and, in general, it was the policy of this strict king, to
raise the standards of public duty, by punishing the
incumbents of public office and penalizing the members
of the learned professions and vocations, rather than
cultivating the higher standards of the professions, by
the elimination of the unskilled therefrom.</p>

<p>The ancient Greeks also practiced the recall and
ostracism of their most eminent judges and other powerful
public officials, who incurred the ill-will of the populace,
because of some unpopular decision, or the envy of
any considerable number of citizens, because of some
alleged undemocratic performance.</p>

<p>This ostracism, or recall, in Greece, is said to have
been established by Cleisthenes after the expulsion of
the Peisistratidae<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and the nature and object of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
recall, as then obtaining, is thus explained by the philosopher
Aristotle:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Democratical states <i>used to</i> ostracise and remove
from the city for a definite time, those who appeared
to be preeminent above their fellow citizens, by reason
of their wealth, the number of their friends, or any
other means of influence.”<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The removal and ostracism of public officers, in
Greece, does not seem to have been used as a punishment
for any crime or particular unfitness developed
by the official removed, but rather as a precautionary
measure, to dispense with the services of those who
became so powerful as to excite the fear or attract the
envy of their contemporaries.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The procedure whereby the recall or ostracism of a
judge or other public official was accomplished, in
ancient Greece, was as follows: A space was enclosed
by barricades, with ten entrances, for the ten tribes.
The tribesmen entered the enclosed space, by these ten
entrances, each with a shell, or piece of earthenware,
on which he wrote the name of the official he wished
recalled or degraded. The casting and enumeration of
the vote was regulated and supervised by the presidents
dents of the Senate and by the nine archons, and if as
many as 6000 votes against any one official was polled,
this <i>ipso facto</i> removed him from office and he was
obliged to leave the city of his residence within ten
days from that date; but if the total number of votes
cast against him did not equal 6000 he was not removed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
from office.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Because of the shell, or piece of earthenware,
upon which the vote was cast against the official
removed from office, the proceeding came to be known
as the “earthenware scourge.”<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>By this proceeding, in ancient Greece, some of the
most distinguished men of the nation were removed,
or ostracised, but when it was found that their services
were indispensable to the public welfare, they were
recalled to office. Cimon, Alcibiades, Themistocles,
Aristeides and many other prominent citizens suffered
this degradation in Athens and other democratical
states, in Greece, for the recall was considered as a
necessary precaution to ensure absolute equality among
the citizens of the various commonwealths.</p>

<p>As a concrete illustration of the application of the
recall to the judiciary, in Greece, we will take the case
of Aristeides, known as “Aristeides the Just.” There
is authority for the statement that the judicial integrity
and ability of this old Greek patriot was so generally
recognized, in Athens, that during the presentation of
one of the tragedies of Eschylus, when one of the characters
was referred to as a man who “cared more <i>to be
just</i>, than to appear so,” all eyes were instantly turned
toward Aristeides, as the one man, who, of all other
Greeks, most merited the title of “The Just,” and
from this time on this truly royal, or divine appellation,
according to Plutarch, was, by universal consent, attributed
to this virtuous man.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>This remarkable distinction aroused envy against
Aristeides and it is reported that Themistocles circulated
a rumor that by determining and judging causes
in private, he was undermining the courts of judicature
and was secretly making way for a monarchy in his own
person, so the jealousies of the populace were so
aroused against him that it was decided to recall this
upright judge. Plutarch relates the pathetic circumstance,
connected with the degradation and ostracism
of this Just Judge, that while the voting was taking
place, in the railed market-place, Aristeides was approached
by an illiterate citizen, who handed him his
<i>ostracon</i>, or sherd and directed him to write his own
name upon the shell. Without disclosing his identity,
Aristeides asked the man if the Judge had ever done
him any injury, when the voter replied: “None at all,
neither know I the man; but I am tired of hearing him
everywhere called <i>The Just</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Aristeides made no reply to the man, but wrote as
he directed and returned the sherd to him, with his
name written upon it. The six thousand votes, necessary
to procure his removal, or recall, having been
polled, he departed from his beloved Athens, praying,
with uplifted hands, that the Athenians might never
have occasion to remember Aristeides.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>The ostracism of Aristeides did not last for the ten
years, for which his punishment was decreed, under the
Grecian law, however, for three years later, when the
Persian king, Xerxes, invaded Greece, Aristeides returned
and when the Persians were overcome he was
completely reinstated in the good graces of his countrymen
and took a leading part in the affairs of the government
of Athens, without resentment, for he sought
no other gratification than that of serving his country
with fidelity and honour.</p>

<p>Themistocles was another of the great citizen jurists
of Athens to suffer the recall or ostracism, by popular
vote, while this ancient law obtained in Greece.</p>

<p>As an index to the character and uprightness of
this distinguished Athenian, it is reported that before
entering upon the trial of a cause in which the poet
Simonides, of Ceos, was interested, when requested,
by his friend, to overlook the underlying principles of
the law, in the consideration of the cause, this virtuous
judge replied:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Simonides, you would be a bad poet, if your lines
ran counter to the just measure and rules of your art,
nor should I be a good magistrate, if, for favor, I made
false law.”<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the signal and loyal services of this
patriotic citizen in the war with the Persians and his
long service as a magistrate, when Themistocles finally
erected his temple of Diana of Best Counsel, with
himself represented by a figure in the temple, the
Athenians also became envious of him and made use<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
of the law providing for the recall and ostracism in
order to humble his eminence and authority, as they
usually did with all those whom they believed to have
grown too powerful, for the equality deemed requisite
in a popular government, for, as said by Plutarch:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The ostracism was instituted not so much to punish
the offender, as to mitigate and pacify the violence
of the envious, who delighted to humble eminent men,
and who, by fixing this disgrace upon them, might vent
some part of their rancor.”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

</div>

<p>According to Aristotle, the law providing for the
recall or ostracism of public officials, by popular vote,
in Athens, soon became mischievous, for:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Men did not look to the interests of the community,
but used ostracism for party purposes.”<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The last person against whom this old law was enforced
at Athens, was Hyperbolus, a demagogue of low
birth and mean habits; the Athenians considered that
in applying this law to such a person, their own dignity
had been compromised, so the law providing for ostracism
or recall, by popular vote, in Athens, was discontinued.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The law providing for the recall or ostracism of public
officers, by popular vote, known as “Petalism”
among the Syracusans, was borrowed from the Athenian
law of ostracism. This species of recall, took its
name from the petals or leaves of the olive, on which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
was written the name of the person whom the citizens
voted to recall.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Under the law of the Syracusans, known as “petalism,”
the removed officer or judge was banished for a
period of five years only, as this was considered a
sufficient length of time to humble the pride and destroy
the hope of the degraded one.</p>

<p>Historians tell us, however, that this law of recall
known as “petalism,” by which the Syracusans voted
to recall their distinguished men, by writing their
names upon the corolla, or leaf-part of the olive, did
not long continue in effect, since the fear of this “degradation
or humbling,” deterred the best qualified
among the citizens from taking any part in public
affairs, and the degeneracy and bad government which
resulted from the selection of only the lowest types of
demagogues for public officers, led to the repeal of the
law, B. C. 452.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>In the early Roman days the custom also obtained of
submitting to the people, by popular vote, the determination
of accusations against judges and other public
officers, as matters of general public interest and the
<i>judicia publica</i> of later times owed its existence to this
antique custom. Preators, or those invested with judicial
functions were no exception to the general rule,
but all classes of public servants were directly responsible
to the Roman people and were liable to be called
upon, at any time, to answer to a charge which might
mean banishment or death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>In the early days of the Republic, every act of a citizen
which was deemed injurious to the State, or its
peace, was called perduellio, and the offender (perduellis)
was tried before the forum of public sentiment
(<i>populi judicio</i>) and, if convicted of any violation of the
obligations he owed to the State, he was put to death.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
The crime known as <i>Majestas</i>, corresponding to the
English charge of treason, was apt, at any time to be
preferred against the most upright public servant and
the opinions of the populace were found frequently at
variance with the justice of the cause. Justice was not
always found to be consistent with the expressed will
of the multitude of Roman citizenship, for their opinions
were not always shaped or controled by the most
exalted standards of equality. Unpopular officials were
frequently condemned, regardless of the reason for the
unpopularity, while the able orator or popular citizen,
was usually successful in his cause.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Under the empire, judicial magistrates, such as Preators,
were removed, at the will of the Emperor, and we
find that while Julius Caesar had appointed sixteen, to
settle the disputes of the Romans, Augustus peremptorily
removed four and thus reduced the number to
twelve.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The early Anglo-Saxons, like the Israelites of patriarchial
days, while recognizing that the power of distributing
or enforcing justice, was primarily lodged
with the people, as a whole, constituting the great body
of society, understood the impossibility of administering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
justice, in the concrete, by delegating the performance
of such important functions, without investigation
or the understanding of correct ideals, to the great
unskilled mass of the people, in their collective capacity,
so apt to be carried away, in such matters, by variable
sentiments, or whims or caprices, based upon impulses,
not always consistent with the proper standards
of right.</p>

<p>In order to insure the rendition of justice to every
individual, or to approximate as nearly as might be, to
this object, this important power was committed, therefore,
at a very early day, in England, to specially selected
magistrates, possessing peculiar skill and fitness to
hear and determine causes in courts of law and qualified,
by study and training to discharge these difficult
public functions with certainty and expedition, according
to correct standards.</p>

<p>Following the beneficent policy, illustrated by the
old Mosaic code, of bringing justice home to every
man’s door, as nearly as may he, it was the general
plan of Anglo-Saxon society, as designed and shaped
by the great King Alfred and other early kings, to have
such a system of courts as would speedily dispense justice
to all the people, under the various conditions of
society. Anglo-Saxon courts did not have the means
of compelling obedience to their mandates for the majesty
of the law was not the rule implicitly followed
by all classes, in the beginning, but before many centuries,
following King Alfred’s time, we find that it had
become the fixed rule of life.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>From the early <i>gemot</i>, of the Anglo-Saxon period,
we soon find the regular county court and hundred
court, where poor and rich alike were entitled to receive
justice, without price and without delay.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The
expeditious court of <i>piepoudre</i>, (the dusty foot court)—which
dispensed justice as speedily as dust falls from
the foot<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>—furnished speedy justice for small cases,
while the <i>curia regis</i>, established by William the Conqueror,
held in the royal palace, presided over by the
king himself and his chief justiciar, with court barons,
presided over by the lords of the realm, furnished, for
many centuries a complete system of judiciture for the
hearing of the ordinary causes in the realm.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The
King was the fountain of justice and it was his business
to see justice done, where the litigant failed to get
his cause heard in the jurisdiction of his own hundred.
Of course as a natural result of such a policy, the right
of dispensing justice and receiving the profits thereof,
under the Normans, soon became hereditary rights,
passing to successive lords, whose judgments were supreme,
unless the King himself ordered the entering of
a certain judgment.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The Court of King’s Bench, the
Court of Common Pleas and the High Court of Chancery,
by gradual processes of time, succeeded to the
principal places among the courts of later centuries,
with the establishment by Henry II., A. D. 1176, of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
<i>justices itinerant</i>, who divided the realm into six circuits
and afterwards followed a fixed judicial system.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>From the reign of William the Conqueror, until that
of King John, the administration of Justice was still
kept in the hands of the king, who was regarded as the
source of all justice and law; after the conquest, the
various prerogatives of the crown were increased and
it was during this precarious state of the law that the
subjects were obliged to purchase the favor of the
sovereign, in order to obtain justice in the king’s
courts.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>So dependent upon the will of the sovereign was the
tenure of the judge, during the reign of Richard I., that
we find William de Longchamp, chief justiciary and
chancellor, was removed from his office, by the intrigue
of John, Earl of Morton, the king’s brother.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Judges were then but the servants of the king and he
could move them about as mere pawns upon the chess
board of his own expediency, or dismiss them, at a
moment’s notice, if they refused to do his bidding.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[41]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
Hubert de Burgh succeeded Hubert Walter and Geoffry
Fitz Peter, as Chief Justiciar, but he seldom sat on the
bench and was removed in 1232,<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> when the Chief
Justiciarship was committed to a lawyer, named
Stephen Segrave. The latter was disgraced and dismissed
by the King, in 1234, just two years after his
appointment and from this period until 1258, or until
the revolution, the justiciarship was in abeyance.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>In lieu of an appeal, or writ of error, which challenged
the sufficiency or correctness of a record or
judgment, instead of the judge himself, we find that
from the time of Cnut, until the reign of Henry I., if a
judgment was challenged the proceeding was what was
known as that of “false judgment,” growing out of the
practice of early Saxon days, when a litigant who was
dissatisfied with a decision or “doom,” charged the
doomsman who uttered it with falsehood.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Until the thirteenth century the exception to a given
judgment or decree of an inferior court was tested by
the charge of “false judgment.” The record was
transferred from the inferior tribunal to the superior
one by certain knights, appointed for the purpose.
Frequently, these knights would challenge the litigant
questioning the correctness of the judgment to trial by
battle, to test the correctness of the decree<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> but if this
were not done, and the issue upon the legality of the
finding of the lower court thus determined, the justices
of the king’s court proceeded to examine the record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>If the King’s Justices found, on an examination of
the record that the judgment of the county, the hundred
or the manor, were wrong, a fine was assessed
against the judge rendering the erroneous judgment
and by a finding of “false judgment” a Lord lost
forever the right to hold a court.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Here was a method of recall, almost as bad as that
existing under the Babylonian Empire, for instead of
removing the judge who attempted to right a wrong, he
was removed before having been given the opportunity
to get right.</p>

<p>As late as the year 1219 we find that the justices in
eyre were brought before the justices of the Court of
King’s Bench, upon a charge of “false judgment,” for
having unlawfully condemned a man to death and upon
examination of the record by the Council, their judgment
was set aside and they were amerced with a fine
for having entered such a “false judgment.”<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>It is little wonder, with this harsh rule obtaining,
that by the time of Edward I. history records that his
justices had become extremely cautious men, unwilling
to decide nice points of law but referring every close
question to the Council for instruction.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The penalty
of a mistake or “false judgment” to them meant not
only a fine, but disgrace and the recall, if the King saw
fit to so punish them, so this was not only calculated to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
make a man cautions, but to prevent those of skill and
dignity from risking the expression of their judgment,
when the penalty for a mistake was such that it might
forever ruin the future life and hopes of the judge
pronouncing judgment. The strange thing is that with
such a system, any self respecting man could be found
to undertake the performance of functions such as
those required of a judge, when his behavior was the
means of ruining his future life, regardless of his pure
intentions in the performance of his official duty.</p>

<p>The tenure of office of the English judge continued
for centuries, to be at the pleasure of the Crown, and
under the Plantagenets and the Tudors, a Chief-Justice
even, might be removed, like any other officer of the
King, at the pleasure of the sovereign,<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and during
this whole period we find that the standards of the
judiciary were in keeping with this servile and undignified
conception of the duties of such an office, for the
judges, with but few exceptions, during this period of
servile attachment to the Crown, were men of but
mediocre ability, willing to prostitute their high offices,
to hold the esteem and favor of their patron.</p>

<p>It was thus found, by experience, in England, that
the proper discharge of the impartial duties of the
courts was consistent only with the maintenance, at all
times, of their dignity and independence, hence, it was
enacted, by statute, (13 William III., c. 2) that the
commissions of judges were to be held, not as formerly,
during the mere pleasure of the king, but so long as
they should conduct themselves uprightly. They can
only be removed from office, upon the address of both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
houses of Parliament and since the reign of George III.,
the commissions of judges are not terminated with the
death of the king, but they continue to hold their office,
notwithstanding the demise of the king, during their
good behavior, or until removed by the joint action of
both houses of Parliament.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>And not only did the English law raise the incumbent
of the judgment seat to a plane where he could view,
with disdain the frowns of the tyrant in the performance
of his official functions, but that he might also be free
from the clamors of the populace, he was exempt from
indictment for any judicial act honestly done, or
omitted, while sitting as a judge. In other words, while
acting in a judicial capacity, judges were not liable for
an honest mistake, but only for fraud or corruption.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The judge is criminally and civilly liable, by the
English common law for judicial acts willfully and maliciously
done; for acts clearly in excess of his proper
jurisdiction and for the wrongful exercise of a mere
ministerial act, whether honestly done or not,<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> but this
was the full limit of his liability and for honest mistakes
in the performance of his duty, he was responsible
to no one and could be troubled only by an accusing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
conscience for a mistake in the performance of a proper
judicial function.</p>

<p>Since the placing of the English judiciary upon this
high plane where the courts are wholly above and beyond
the spoils of party or the favoritism or fears of
sovereignty, the respect paid to the majesty of the law
in that country, has challenged the admiration of the
world. English procedure is the pattern for the best
governed countries on the earth and the decisions of
her courts have come to be ideals to be followed by
courts of other nations, seeking the attainment of
justice.</p>

<p>The patriot fathers, familiar with the mistakes of the
ancients and the reasons for the establishment of the
judicature of England, upon an independent foundation,
in the establishment of the judicial system in the
United States, adopted the method that history had
commended to England, of life tenure, with the power
of removal for actual misfeasance in office.</p>

<p>It was therefore provided in the Federal Constitution
that judges of the courts of the United States
should hold their offices during good behavior and
they were subject to removal, only by impeachment,
like other civil officers of the Government.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The first Congress, in 1789, enacted the first federal
judiciary act, formulated by Oliver Ellsworth, a
member of the convention which framed the Constitution
and afterwards Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court.</p>

<p>Speaking of this earnest patriot, Mr. Webster said
that he was “possessed of the clearest intelligence and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
deepest sagacity as well as the utmost purity and integrity
of character.”</p>

<p>Upon the relative functions of the different branches
of government and the necessity for an independent
judiciary, Chief Justice Ellsworth said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If the general legislature should, at any time, overleap
their limits, the judicial department is a constitutional
check. If the United States go beyond their
powers; if they make a law, which the Constitution does
not authorize, it is void; and the judiciary power, the
national judges, who, to secure their impartiality, <i>are
to be made independent</i>, will declare it to be void. On
the other hand, if the States go beyond their limits, if
they make a law which is a usurpation upon the general
Government, the law is void, and upright, <i>independent
judges</i> will declare it to be so.”</p>

</div>

<p>This, by the gentleman who reported the bill in Congress
for the organization of the judicial department
of the general Government, demonstrates that those
who formed our Government and framed our Constitution,
realized not only that the judgment seat should be
dominated by “the cold neutrality of an impartial
judge,” but that this essential prerequisite to the administration
of justice, could not be obtained by a
cringing judiciary, depending upon a vacillating public
sentiment, as an index to its opinions, but would be
effectuated only through the untrammeled judgment of
an independent court.</p>

<p>Next to Oliver Ellsworth, the man most active in the
establishment of our Federal Judiciary, was perhaps
Alexander Hamilton, and upon the reasons for an absolutely
independent judiciary, this great lawyer,
soldier and patriotic statesman, observed:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This independence of the judges is equally requisite
to guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals
from the effects of those ill-humors which the arts of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
designing men or the influence of particular conjunctures
sometimes disseminate among the people themselves
and which, though they speedily give place to
better information, and more deliberate reflection, have
a tendency, in the meantime, to occasion dangerous innovations
in the Government and serious oppressions
of the minor party in the community.”<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It was also clearly the object of the original thirteen
colonies to remove the judiciary from politics and
thereby establish the independence of the State Judiciary,
as well as that of the Federal Government, for
the Constitutions of each of the original colonies provided
for an appointive judiciary.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Georgia alone set
the bad example of providing for an elective judiciary,
by direct vote of the people, for a short term, a practice
that historians believe has caused much of the degradation
and humiliation of the state courts, in the past
century.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>In most of the other states in the United States, the
medium was selected, between the life tenure and the
complete independence of the judiciary upon the one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
hand, and the recall and disgrace of the judge, without
the formality of a trial, upon the other, and it was provided
for the election of judges, for short terms of
office, subject to impeachment by the legislative branch
of Government, in cases of misfeasance in office.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>In one state alone was the English method adopted
of appointing the judges for life, or during good behavior,
although four other states have the appointive
judiciary, and it is not strange that in this one state
we find the strongest state court in the United States
and the one whose judgments are received by the various
courts of the other states with the highest degree
of respect.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>By both the Federal and State Constitutions, in the
United States, the judiciary has always been regarded
as an equal and co-ordinate branch of government, with
the legislative and executive. It was accordingly held,
within the past century, that neither the President nor
the Governor could remove a judge, during the term
of office for which he was elected or appointed,<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> but the
only way to remove or recall a judge, was by impeachment
for criminal or corrupt conduct.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>It is thus a serious question whether the experience
of the past century, in the United States, has vindicated
the method followed in so many states, of selecting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
judges, for a moderate term, by an elective system,
subject to impeachment for positive misfeasance in
office. Many protests, other than the growing demand
for a popular recall of judges, may be directly or indirectly
traced to this method of selecting judges and
as the demands and protests come from states where
the tenure to office is for the shorter terms, it seems
that this general policy, when applied to the judiciary,
is condemned both by the examples of history and the
practice and experience of the past century, in the
United States.</p>

<p>There is little doubt but that the great Chief Justice
Marshall would have been recalled, after his decision
against the Government, in the trial of Aaron Burr, for
treason, if the recall of judges by popular vote had then
obtained, in the United States. The power of Jefferson’s
administration was used, unsparingly, to obtain
Burr’s conviction, and he was already convicted in the
forum of public sentiment, for the populace believed
him guilty. The Chief Justice, however, firm in the
consciousness of right, with the true judicial poise, disdained,
with equanimity, the clamor of the populace
and refused to sacrifice the individual, to appease the
public wrath.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> No wonder that through the genius of
this patriot, the Court he presided over was “placed
upon a pedestal of imperishable granite and has become
the admiration of the publicists throughout the
civilized world.”<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>If such a system had then obtained, the country
would have been denied the genius and ability of this
just man, for he would never have been responsible to
the fickle flames of a vacillating public sentiment for the
correctness of his opinions. Addressing himself upon
the necessity for an absolutely independent judiciary,
Chief Justice Marshall said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is to the last degree important that he should be
rendered perfectly and completely independent with
nothing to control him but God and his conscience.”</p>

</div>

<p>Strange, is it not, that the opinions of our patriot
fathers should so nearly approach the views of the
patriarchs of the Mosaic period, upon the qualifications
of the judge, for they too, believed that the courts
should be presided over by “able men out of Israel,
such as feared God, men of truth, hating covetousness”
and when appointed to judge between the alleged rights
of the ancient Hebrews, they were admonished by the
Great Law Giver: “Ye shall not be afraid of the face
of man, for the judgment is God’s.”<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Right well did Moses warn the ancient judges of the
Israelites against the fear of men in the prerogative of
the judgment seat, for public sentiment has ever proven
variable and the proper and just ideals do not always
govern the multitude. We have seen them to-day cry
“Hosanna” and to-morrow “Crucify Him.” And since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
the day when Pilate released Barabas and delivered
the Nazarene to the multitude, because it was popular
for him to do so, the judge who feared “the face of
man” has been deemed unworthy of the trust and dignity
of the judgment seat.</p>

<p>The millions burned at the stake, during the witchcraft
craze, in Europe, were convicted before judges
whose independence had not been established by the
laws of the realm and they simply followed the expressed
will of the multitude in the act of pronouncing
judgment.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>In our own country, during the spread of this delusion,
in Salem, Massachusetts, before the courts were
presided over by judges appointed for life, there were
nineteen innocent persons burned or hanged for witchcraft
in less than one year, and of these fourteen were
women.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>In the case of the gentle Rebecca Nurse, hanged on
Gallows Hill, on July 19, 1692, after her acquittal by a
jury, because the people demanded her blood, and a
subservient judiciary bowed in humble submission to
the <i>vox populi</i>, we find one of the most unjust instances
of the “recall of judicial decisions” in the history of
any country and one of the grossest travesties upon
justice that has been produced.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The fear of the recall of judges, in France, during
the provisional Republic, following the French Revolution,
caused the judges to send a poor weak woman to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
the guillotine, because she possessed the foibles of her
sex and the flower of the aristocracy of the country
was sent innocent to their death, because a wrought
up multitude demanded their slaughter. Oh, for the
glory of an independent judiciary, in such a crisis and
what a valuable lesson history affords against the precedents
made by public sentiment.</p>

<p>The courts alone protect the rights of the minority,
for the legislative and executive are subservient to the
expressed will of the majority. In the courts, however,
the property of the rich and the poor alike is protected
from the might of the powerful and the will of the
majority, because the law of the land, in recognition of
the right of the minority to enjoy life, liberty and property,
in this free land of ours, has provided that no
property can be taken, however popular it might be to
appropriate it, without just compensation, after a trial,
upon due process. But when the judges were but the
servants of the majority, of course the wishes of the
majority controlled them, hence the necessity of making
them independent of both the majority and minority.</p>

<p>We have seen how the recall of judges by popular
vote, in Babylon and Greece weakened and destroyed
their independence and made them subservient tools of
the popular and great leaders of the majority; that in
time the respect of the community for the judges so
situated was completely destroyed and that the fear of
humiliation and disgrace prevented gentleman of dignity
and ability from seeking such a precarious place
and the whole judicial system was thereby perverted
and deranged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>Commenting upon the condition which the recall of
judges by popular vote brought about in Greece, we
have the valuable testimony of Aristotle who said:<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Those who have any complaints to bring against
the magistrates say: ‘<i>Let the people be judges</i>’; the
people are too happy to accept the invitation and so the
authority of every office is undermined. Such a democracy
is fairly open to the objection that it is not a
constitution at all, for where the laws have no authority
there is no constitution.”</p>

</div>

<p>The framers of our constitution were familiar with
the experiments of ancient Greece and the mistakes of
the early Anglo-Saxons, and this is why the Constitution
guarantees to “every state in the union a Republican
form of government.”<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Shall the illuminating precedents of history, ever be
forgotten; shall the land-marks of the fathers and the
light-houses, planted upon the shoals upon which other
ships of state have floundered, be torn away? Are the
secrets of the old dooms day books of the Anglo-Saxons,
to be read in vain and the mistakes of the law of ostracism
of the Athenians and the discarded and condemned
law of petalism, of the Syracusans, to be
adopted in the United States, in the twentieth century?<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>If the day shall ever come, in the United States, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
this mistaken custom of the Babylonians and the ancient
Athenians shall be generally established, and the
disappointed suitor and political demagogue can
gather his associates and bid the judge come down
from his judgment seat to answer the excited multitude
for the correctness of his judgments, then the safeguards
of the Constitution, guaranteed to us by the
patriot fathers will be trampled under foot; this will
cease to be a Government of law and become a mere
aggregation of people, where law is not the rule of
life.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The statesmen of ancient Greece found that the judge
could not be safely tried by political methods, for the
elements of personal ambition, favoritism, money interest,
envy and divers other equations, were likely to
be used in passing upon the qualifications of the judge,
when arraigned before the forum of a wrought up
public sentiment. Nor would it be different in any
other country, under similar conditions.</p>

<p>In the days of Hammurabi, when the courts were so
much concerned about the trials of those supposed to
“weave spells over a man” and his guilt or innocence
was determined by his survival of the torrent of the
“holy river;” when the standards of justice were such
that the surgeon, who was unsuccessful in an operation,
lost his hands; when the veterinarian paid for all the
stock he could not cure; the builder, or artisan, all
damages resulting from a house he had built afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
falling down. When, in all the relations of life—save
that of the royal prerogatives—the test of human
action was the exalted ideal of infallibility, then the
judge who set aside a judgment was humiliated and disgraced
and peremptorily removed from office. All
morality was on a par with such ideals of the exalted
virtues like justice, and brides were auctioned off by
their fathers to the highest bidder and all human action
was in keeping with such dark days of superstition
and delusion.</p>

<p>The behavior of the judge of the time of Cnut, in
England, when he was liable to be fined and removed
for entering “a false judgment,” was in strict accord
with the low standards of justice then obtaining and
from this degraded position of the judiciary, to that of
the exalted notion of an absolutely independent judiciary,
there was the same difference in the quality of
justice administered, that obtained between the generally
ignorant men selected to parcel out the right, for
remuneration, in those dark days and the pure and
scholarly jurists, who, for centuries have made the administration
of the law, in England, the admiration of
the civilized world. The history of the judiciary, in
England, has certainly demonstrated the wisdom of an
independent judiciary, for no country pays the same
high regard to the majesty of the law and in none are
the correct ideals in legal standards more nearly approximated,
than in England.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>One does not have to become an Anglo-Maniac to
feel a just pride in the stability and perfection of an
institution, such as the English judiciary, for all who
make law a rule of life, can but revere the approximation
of an ideal where its reign is supreme.</p>

<p>In the consideration of this antiquated and condemned
institution, known as “Judicial Recall,” space
has forbidden that we should do more than merely
touch upon the centuries as mile-stones, in hurrying
through the ages. From the facts of history presented,
however, it seems strange that in the evolution of the
race, amid the cultivated ideals of our twentieth century
civilization, so many of our states would seemingly refuse
to profit by the mistakes in the Leges Barbarorum
of the dark ages; that they would apparently turn aside
from the sad picture of the early struggle for law
and—defying the axiom that we can but “judge the
future by the past of man”—indulge the vain hope of
utilizing the popular recall of judges as a panacea for
all the social evils of modern times.</p>

<p>The patriot fathers, profiting by the accumulated
wisdom of the past, builded an edifice in this free land
of ours, bottomed upon the solid foundation of constitutional
principles, sufficiently enduring to withstand the
most tempestuous seas of partisan politics, because
they profited by the record which history recorded of
the stranded wrecks of states upon the shores of time.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
Our fathers and their children have occupied this temple
for over a century and we should have a care how
we undermine the walls or remove the high priest of
our liberties, with rough hands, from the sacred altar.
Many a hearth-stone in this and future ages will need
the protection guaranteed by the fundamental principle
of government, which perpetuates the independence
of the judicial department and the statesmen of the
present age, without thinking of the permanence of
their work, are making right and wrong for succeeding
ages and by tampering with the institutions that time
has approved, they may incur the everlasting condemnation
of the citizens of succeeding commonwealths.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_159" href="#FNanchor_159" class="label">[1]</a> Speaking upon the antiquity of courts and judges, John, in
his “Babylonian and Assyrian Laws,” says: “Partly because specific
reference to judges and legal processes are not necessarily to be expected
in historical inscriptions, and partly because we do not really
know which are the earliest monuments of the human race, it is
impossible to decide when law-courts first came into existence. It
is generally admitted, however, that the stele of Manistusu is one
of the earliest known monuments. There we read of Galzu, a
judge. There also we find many of the officials, who later acted as
judges upon occasion. Hence it may fairly be said that judges
were to be found in ancient Babylonia from time immemorial. They
must have decided what was right when there was no written law
to which to appeal.”</p>

<p>A notable case of the recall of judges as late as five hundred
years before Christ occurred among the Medes and Persians, who
boasted of their unalterable decrees, once rendered by the incumbent
of the <i>dangerous</i> judgment-seat.</p>

<p>Herodotus tells the thrilling story of the striking example furnished
by King Cambyses, in his final recall of the unjust judge,
named Sisamnes. He caused him to be killed and flayed and the
judgment-seat to be covered with his skin. He then appointed the
son of Sisamnes to be his successor, but charged him, while sitting
in judgment, to remember the fate of his father. This example
might be resorted to by the agitators for the judicial recall, as a
more terrible example to an unjust judge than the mere recall and
degradation.</p>

Zirra. They sold him for twenty-three sheckels to Nabu-Zer-ukin. He
must have fled from his new master, for four years later the same
people pledged him. He was not a satisfactory pledge, for next
we find that Gaga’s daughter, about to be married, this slave was
set down as a part of her marriage portion, and she gave him to her
husband and his son, and he remained in their possession, but
when his mistress died, he was handed over to the great banker,
Itti-Marduk-balatu. During the reign of Nabonidus, the slave, Bariki-ilu,
attempted to establish his freedom, by pretending to be the
adopted son of Bal-rim-ani, but was made to confess that he had
twice run away from his master and had been many days in hiding,
so it was adjudged that he must return to servitude.” John’s “Babylonian

<p>The conditions existing before the Barons exacted from King
John the various guaranties of the Great Charter are known to all
readers of English History. The reasons why they stipulated that
“Right shall not be sold, delayed or denied”; that the king should
only appoint “justiciaries, sheriffs and bailiffs, of such as know the
law of the land and are disposed duly to observe it” is emphasized
by a consideration of the many highhanded proceedings that the
people of that long suffering country had been subjected to before
this Great Charter of liberty was exacted from King John. (I.

<span class="smcap">Trial by Battle.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Trial by battle, sometimes called “wager of battel,”
or “battile,” as Bouvier refers to it, could be claimed
in appeals of felony and in certain civil cases and was
of frequent use in affairs of chivalry and honor.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>No tradition can tell us just when the trial by combat
first came into existence.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Wager of battle was a
natural accompaniment of the state of society existing
when men were accustomed to take the law into their
own hands and test the right by the might that could
back it up. Battle has always been the law among the
lower animals and in the evolution of the species, before
society had developed the standards of our present
civilization, the males of the human species, in barbarous
nations, won the females much oftener through the
law of battle, than by the display of intellectual attainments.</p>

<p>Trial by battle, therefore, may be traced to the most
ancient period. Sacred writ gives an analogous contest,
in the memorable battle between King David and
Goliah, and the destinies of nations, instead of the
rights of individuals, were made to depend upon the
outcome of the combat. Goliah challenged the Israelites:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Choose you a man for you, and let him come down
to me. If he be able to fight with me and to kill me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against
him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants and
serve us.”<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And, as the principals in the trial by battle always
relied upon the grace of God to further the righteousness
of their cause, so King David, in his battle, relied
upon the God who had saved him from the lion and delivered
him from the paw of the bear, to bring to a successful
issue, his contest with the giant. He went to
the fight in the name of the “Lord of Hosts,” the God
of the armies of Israel, and proclaimed that it was
“His battle,” and he fought not with sword and spear,
but would deliver the Philistines into his hands.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The soldier and historian, Paterculus, is authority
for the statement that during the first half of the first
century, when Quintilius Varus attempted the settlement
of disputes among the Germans by law, he discovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
that their custom had been to decide all such
controversies by single combat.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Neilson<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> refers to the traditional statement of King
Frotho the Third in the misty age of Denmark, that he
“deemed it much fitter to contend with weapons than
with words,” in the settlement of private disputes, and
he shows how this sentiment found firm lodgment in
the breast of the Norseman, whose supreme God was
Odin, the God of war, for valor was the jewel of his
soul.</p>

<p>Selden states that the decision of suits by appeal to
the God of battle is said to have been invented by the
Burgundi, one of the northern of the German clans that
flourished before the subjugation of the Gauls by the
Romans. And it is true, that the first written injunction
of judiciary combats that we meet with is in the
laws of Gundibald, A. D. 501, which are preserved in
the Burgundian code. It was not a mere local custom
of that particular tribe, however, but was the common
usage of all those warlike people, from the earliest
times.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Judicial duels, or combats by individuals, according
to forms of law, obtained among the ancient Goths, in
Sweden,<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and this form of “searching out hidden
truths,” as Selden observes, was practiced by the Russians,
Hungarians, Almains and Normans.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>History records that the Emperor Otho, A. D. 983, at
Verona, held a diet at which were assembled many
lords and princes from France, Germany and Italy and
in order to discourage perjury in judicial trials, the convention
substituted the trial by battle in all cases, in
lieu of the oaths or testimony of witnesses.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>In the early feudal ages, “when knighthood was in
flower,” chivalry played no small part in the growth
and development of the fixed rules governing the trial
by battle.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Chivalry has always been in the world,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
but it finds expression according to the customs obtaining
in the different stages of man’s growth and development.
Because fighting was then the order of the day,
in the olden times, knights were sacrificed by personal
combat, for their ladies faire. When trial by battle
was on the decline, Sir Walter Raleigh expressed the
spirit of chivalry of that period, by spreading his
cloak upon the ground for his queen to walk upon. And
in this our twentieth century, with the progress of the
race,—be it ever recorded to the credit of the manhood
of the period—this same spirit was exemplified by the
splendid lesson of hundreds of noble men heroically
accepting the terrors of a mighty sea, in order to
rescue the women and children from a sinking ship.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The deeds of knighthood, in the England of the
middle ages, came to be gauged according to fixed and
settled rules and customs and finally the <i>Court of Honor</i>,
was recognized, the same as the court of civil procedure,
for the trial of affairs of honor, for, says Blackstone:
“This court of chivalry, can order reparation at
the point of honor.”<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The proceedings of this court were by petition, in a
summary manner, and the trial, instead of by a jury,
as at the present day, with witnesses, was by individual
combat.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Court of Honor</i> was not a court of record and it
could not imprison, but the marshalling of arms, was
then the pride of the best families of the kingdom and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
the success in these affairs of honor, because of the
spirit of chivalry of the times, was just as much
guarded as was the attainment of justice through the
procedure of the civil courts. Heralds and knights
seconded and backed up the appeals of the principals in
such encounters and the sacrifice of the individual in
these mortal combats was regarded as a trifle, compared
to the preservation of the family name and honor
and since his attainder and the corruption of his blood
and family name depended upon his success in the combat,
the wager of battle was welcomed, as the only vindication
of one’s manhood and honor.</p>

<p>The trial by battle, therefore, at a very early day,
proceeded according to fixed, settled rules of law and
was a recognized mode of legal procedure, just as much
as was the trial by judicial proceedings. In this it
differed from duelling, in that the latter was the fighting
of two persons, at an appointed time and place, in
the absence of law and order. In other words, the
trial by battle was a mode of legal procedure, while
duelling was a crime, in that the duel was not conducted
according to legal rules and precedents, but the participants
took the law into their own hands.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Trial by battle was introduced into England, among
other Norman customs, by William the Conqueror. The
right could only be claimed in three classes of cases, i. e.,
military, or in the court martial, or court of chivalry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
or honor;<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> criminal, or in appeals of felony,<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and civil,
or upon issue joined in a writ of right, the last and
most solemn decision of real property.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The reason
why battle was allowed in “writs of right,” was said to
be on account of the inability of establishing one’s title
by action at law, in case of the death of witnesses or
the absence of other evidence.</p>

<p>In the criminal practice the one exercising the right
to wager of battle was called the “Appellee,” from the
French word “Appeller,” meaning “to call,” the term
being used because of the practice of calling the parties
before the court.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>The points of difference between a trial by combat,
under the writ of right and one for treason, are noted
by Neilson, in his “Trial by Combat” and principal
among them are, that the trial at law could be fought
before any judge, while the trial for treason had to be
before the King, Constable or Marshal, or a special
deputy; the forms of oath were different; the duel at
law was fought on foot, while for treason, it was fought
on horse-back; the weapon of the trial at law, was the
baton, while that for treason, was the sword and spear;
the position of the combatants, in a writ of right, was
north and south, while in a trial for treason, it was
east and west, and in the battle under a writ of right,
since the trial itself was the judgment, there was no
right to stop the trial, but in a trial for treason, the
king, or his representatives could stop the trial, if he
so desired.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>In the appeal of felony, the prosecutor was bound to
offer combat with his own body, but in the writ of
right, the demandant could either participate in his
own behalf, or through the medium of his champions’
services.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> But even in the Norman days, when battle
was in vogue, “battle did not lie” unless there was a
charge of crime and at least ten shillings’ worth of property
was in dispute.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> In civil cases, professional
pugilists were commonly employed and perjury became
so common that the form of the compurgator’s
oath was changed to prevent the wholesale commission<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
of this crime.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The commonest cause of battles were
those urged by an “approver,” or convicted criminal,
whose pardon was conditional upon his ridding the
kingdom of some half dozen or more of his associates,
by his “appeals.” This custom, however, began to decline
so rapidly, that in Bracton’s day the annual average
of battles did not exceed twenty.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The old books indicate that in appeals of felony, the
custom was for the combatants to have their heads
shaved, not to prevent the opponent from catching hold
of the hair, but because it was an old religious custom.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>In discussing the trial by combat, in finance, Neilson
shows how, during the reign of Henry II., large sums
were paid to crown officers, for the privilege of the
duel; for refusal to fight, or absence, and for fines for
wrongfully claiming the right to the duel, and the same
thing was true in the reign of Richard I.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Edward III. the trial by battle
was discouraged by the legislation of the period and
trial by jury was encouraged. The right of trial by
battle was taken away in the case of an appeal for
breaking the king’s prison, and the right was also denied
to one “taken with the manner.”<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> And during
the reigns of Edward V. and Richard III., the trial by
battle in criminal cases had become so obnoxious to the
people of England that it came to be established that if
a valid indictment was pending for the offense charged,
the right of trial by battle was denied.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>In the reign of Henry VI., Priscot, Chief Justice, and
Needham, one of the Justices, held that in an appeal for
treason, the battle could only be had before the constable
and marshal.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>Wager of battle had been but seldom invoked in actions
of debt, and in the thirteenth century, it was no
longer allowed in this class of actions.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>A generation after the Norman conquest, Henry I., by
Charter to the City of London,<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> granted exemption
from the trial by battle to citizens of London, or peers
of the realm, in certain cases, and a woman, a priest,
an infant, a man of sixty or over, or one maimed, lame,
or blind, was entitled to refuse the wager of battle and
insist upon a trial by jury.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>In civil combat, upon issue joined in a writ of right,
the tenant or defendant had to try the issue by combat,
until the reign of Henry II., when the Grand Assize was
provided for, and then he had his election either to try
the issue by combat or by the jury trial, provided for
by this king in this class of cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>Glanville,<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> who wrote during the reign of Henry II.,
after the tenant was given his election to try his writ
of right either by combat, or by the Grand Assize, thus
describes the procedure then obtaining under the rule
of civil combat:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Both parties being present in court, and the demandant
claiming the land in question, the tenant may
require the view thereof: but as to this, there is respite
to be made, to the end it may be known, whether the
defendant have not more land in that town than what
is in question; and if he have not, then he shall not be
allowed any respite; but if he have more, he shall; and
likewise have assignation of another day; and, when he
shall be so departed out of the court, at three reasonable
essoins,<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> the defendant may recover anew; and the
shireeve of the county wherein the land lieth shall have
a writ directed to him to send freeholders of his county
to view the land.</p>

<p>“Then, after three reasonable essoins, concomitating
the view of the said land, and both demandant and
tenant appearing again in court, the demandant setteth
forth his claim in this manner: ‘I do challenge against
T. H. half a knight’s fee, or two carucates of land in
that town, as my right and inheritance; and whereof, my
father, or grandfather, was seised in his demesne, as
of fee, in the time of King Henry I., or after the first
coronation of the King that now is, and whereof he
hath taken the profits, to the value of 10s. at the least,
viz., in corn sowed, and other commodities; and this I
am ready to try by this my freeman N.; and if any mischance
shall befall him, then by that other person who
hath seen and heard this.’ Or thus,—‘And this I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
ready to try by this my freeman, S. unto whom his
father, on his death-bed enjoined, upon the duty wherein
a son is obliged to a father, that if at any time he
should hear of a suit for that land, he should adventure
himself, by combat for it, as that which his father had
seen and heard.’</p>

<p>“The claim and demand of the demandant being thus
made, it shall be in the choice of the tenant, either to
put himself upon trial for the same by <i>combat</i>, or to
put himself upon the <i>great assize</i> of our lord, the king,
and to require a recognition which of them hath most
right in that land.</p>

<p>“And if he will defend it by <i>combat</i>, he is then
obliged to defend the right of the demandant word to
word as he sheweth it against him, either by himself or
some other fitting person; but note, that after the <i>combate</i>
shall be thereupon waged, it behoveth him who
holdeth the land, to defend it by <i>combate</i>, and thenceforth
not to put himself into the <i>great assize</i>; and, after
the <i>combat</i> waged, he may again reasonably essoins
himself thrice, as for his own person, and thrice for the
person of his champion. All which essoins being made,
as they rightly ought to be, it is necessary that, before
the <i>combat</i> be begun, the plaintiff do appear in court,
and have his champion there in readiness to fight; nor
may he bring any other champion than one of those,
upon whom he did put the trial of his cause; neither
may he change another for him, after the first waging
of the battle....</p>

<p>“And if the defender (i. e., the champion) shall
happen to be vanquished, his lord shall lose the land by
him claimed, with the profits and commodities thereof,
at the time of the seisin found in that fee, and shall
never after be heard in court again for the same; but
whatsoever things shall be determined by combat in
the court of our lord the king are to remain firm forever;
and thereupon there shall be a precept directed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
the shireeve, that the victor shall have the land which
was in dispute....</p>

<p>“This, if the demandant shall prevail in the combat;
but if he be overthrown by the vanquishing of his
champion, then the tenant shall be acquitted from his
claim without recovery by the demandant.”<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Selden describes the ceremony governing the civil
combat, upon issue joined upon a writ of right,<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A piece of ground is in due time set out of sixty
feet square, enclosed with lists; and on one side, a court
erected for the judges of the court of common pleas,
who attend there in their scarlet robes; and also a bar
is prepared for the learned serjeants at law. When the
court sits, which ought to be by sun-rising, proclamation
is made for the parties and their champions, who
are introduced by two knights, and are in a coat of
armour, with red sandals, bare-legged from the knee
downward, bare-headed, and with bare arms to the elbows.
The weapons allowed them are only <i>batons</i>, or
staves of an ell long and a four-cornered leather target,
so that death very seldom ensued this civil combat ...</p>

<p>“When the champions, thus armed with batons, arrive
within the lists or place of combat, the champion
of the tenant then takes his adversary by the hand and
makes oath that the tenements in dispute are not the
right of the demandant; and the champion of the demandant
then taking the other by the hand, swears in
the same manner that they are; so that each champion
is, or ought to be, thoroughly persuaded of the truth of
the cause he fights for. Next an oath against sorcery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
and enchantment is to be taken by both the champions
in this or a similar form: ‘Here this, ye justices, that I
have this day, neither eat, drank, nor have upon me
neither bone, stone, no grass nor any enchantment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
sorcery, or witchcraft, whereby the law of God may be
abased, or the law of the devil exalted, so help me, God
and his saints.’</p>

<p>“The battle is thus begun, and the combatants are
bound to fight till the stars appear in the evening; and
if the champion of the tenant can defend himself till
the stars appear, the tenant shall prevail in his cause;
for it is sufficient for him to maintain his ground, and
make it a drawn battle, he being already in possession;
but if victory declares itself for either party, for him is
judgment finally given. This victory may arise from
the death of either of the champions, which indeed, hath
rarely happened, the whole ceremony, to say the truth,
bearing a near resemblance to certain rural athletic
diversions, which are probably derived from this original;
or victory is obtained, if either champion proves
<i>recreant</i>; that is, yields, and pronounces the horrible
word of <i>craven</i>, a word of disgrace and obloquy rather
than of any determinate meaning: but a horrible word
it indeed is, to the vanquished champion, since, as a
punishment to him, for forfeiting the land, of his principal,
by pronouncing that shameful word, he is condemned
as a recreant <i>amittere liberam legem</i>; that is, to
become infamous, and not be accounted <i>liber et legalis
homo</i> being supposed by the event to be proved foresworn,
and therefore never to be put upon a jury, or
admitted as a witness in any cause.”</p>

</div>

<p>Combat in criminal cases was allowed, according to
Selden<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> not only in cases of treason but</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For the trial of a particular objected misdeed,
cognizable by the ordinary course of the common law;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
and of these the justices of the king’s bench have the
imposition; it is likewise permitted for the purgation
of an offense against military honor, which the high
court of chivalry is to marshal by the law of arms.”</p>

</div>

<p>The military form of trial by combat, on a criminal
charge was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“First a bill of challenge is, together with a gauntlet,
delivered unto the court by the appellant. The defendant
denieth the point of the bill, and excepteth the
gauntlet.</p>

<p>“Then, if the appellant have no witnesses to prove
the matter of his appeal, the marshal prefixes a day,
within forty, for deraigning the combat, taking pledges
of both parties, to appear at the day, and to do battle
between sun-rising and sun-set.</p>

<p>“The place appointed for the combat is a hard and
even ground, railed within certain lists, sixty feet in
length and forty feet in breadth; and without the lists
are certain counter-lists, without which the marshal’s
men come, as well to attend any extraordinary accident,
within the lists, as to keep off the press of the people
without.</p>

<p>“Their weapons are appointed, a glaive, a long
sword, a short sword, and a dagger. At the day the
appellant doth appear and come to the east gate of the
lists, where he is admitted to enter by the marshal himself,
together with his arms, weapons, victual and also
his council with him; and then is brought to a certain
place, within the lists, where he attends the coming of
the defendant.</p>

<p>“The defendant, if he appear not, is called by three
proclamations, made by the marshal of the king of
heralds of that province wherein the battle is deraigned.
The marshal’s clerk doth enter into his register
their coming, the time of their coming, and the
manner, whether on horse-back or on foot; the fashion
of their arms and their weapons; the colour of their
horses and the like.</p>

<p>“The marshal doth measure their weapons; and then
the marshal hath a clerk ready, who brings forth the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
crucifix and a mass book, whereupon both the appellant
and defendant do take their oaths.</p>

<p>“The bill of challenge of the appellant and the
answer of the defendant, is read unto them by the
marshal’s clerk; and then they take their oaths; First,
that their appeal and defense is true; Second, that
neither has advantage of other by weapon; Third, that
either would do his best endeavour to vanquish his
enemy.</p>

<p>“Then proclamation is made at every corner of the
lists, for the clearing and voidance of the lists. Then
the combatants, being ready, the constable and marshal,
sitting at the king’s feet, pronounce these words, with a
high voice: ‘<i>Lesses les aller, lesses les aller, lesses les
aller et faire leur devoir.</i>’</p>

<p>“In the fight, if either of the parties do give any
sign of yielding; or if the king, being present, do cry
‘<i>Hoe</i>,’ the constable and the marshal do part them, and
observe precisely who hath advantage or disadvantage,
either of other at that instant; for if they should be
awarded to fight again, they are to be put in the same
posture as they were before. If the king take up the
matter, they are brought honorably out of the lists,
neither having precedency before the other. If the
battle be performed, and one party be vanquished, then,
in case of treason, the rails of the lists are broken down,
and the party vanquished is drawn out at a horse-tail
and carried presently to execution by the marshal.”<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The older books abound in many illustrations where
the appellee, when charged by a formal accusation, with
some felony, claimed the wager of battle to establish
his innocence.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Neilson refers to the single combat between Corbis
and Orsus, fought in the presence of Scipio, for a principality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
in Spain.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> And the traditional combat, in prehistoric
Roman days, between the Horatti and the Curiatti
is also cited, to show that the institution of trial
by combat was not unknown to the Romans, at an early
day.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Geoffrey of Monmouth, describes the battle between
King Arthur and Flollo, the Roman Tribune, at the
siege of Paris, to determine who would be the master
of the realm, and this realistic story of the battle, on
horses, with fixed lances and the interesting narration
of how King Arthur, after his horse was killed under
him, drove his sword through the helmet of Flollo and
cut his head in two, reads like some story from the
works of fiction.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Neilson notes<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> that in Mediaeval Germany, disputes
between men and women were settled by combat, for
chivalry does not seem to have penetrated into the warlike
confines of this sturdy nation, at this period, although
some notion of equalizing the contests between
the weaker combatant and the stronger, obtained. The
male was handicapped, in such contests, by placing
him in a tub, sunk waist deep in the ground, with one
hand tied behind his back. The woman was allowed a
paving stone, sewed in the end of the long sleeve of her
shift, or under garment and she was accorded the privilege
of manouvering around her antagonist, at will, until
she found a vulnerable point of attack.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps the earliest reference to the trial by battle,
among the adjudicated English cases, is that of Wulfstan
vs. Walter, of which Lea reports that the witnesses
who saw the trial stood ready to prove their
assertions regarding it, by “oath and battle.”<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The mandate of the Conqueror’s law, that the mutilated
trunk, of the defendant, convicted of treason, by
combat, should remain as an evidence of his crime, in
order to deter others from this hated offense, was exemplified,
in the year 1096, in the case of William of
Eu,<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> who, after trial by combat, had his eyes torn out
and thus bereft of his sight, was sadly left to wander
alone and despised through the world, a living example
of the vengeance of the Lord, for the offense that he
had been convicted of, by this hap-hazard method.</p>

<p>The battle between Henry, Earl of Essex and Robert
de Montford, in the year 1163, on an island in the
Thames, near the Abbey, is well attested by the history
of that period. The charge of treason was preferred
in Parliament and the combat was adjudged, because
of the alleged cowardice of the Earl of Essex, during
the Welsh war of 1157, in precipitating a panic, during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
a decisive engagement in a narrow pass, by throwing
down his banner and giving the alarm that the king had
been slain. De Montford was victorious in the battle
which followed and though Essex made a fierce attack
upon him, his blows were warded off and the Earl was
defeated and left for dead upon the field of battle.
His body was given to the Monks of Reading, for burial
and he was revived and allowed to become a Monk
himself.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>“Hobbe-the-Werwede,” an approver, much spoken
of in the old books discussing trial by battle, in the
fourth year of King Henry III. defeated “Walter-in-the-Grove,”
but Hobbe soon afterwards faced another
opponent and like many of our modern pugilists, went
down to defeat, in his last battle.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>On October 4’, 1350, Sir John de Visconti fought Sir
Thomas de la Marche, before King Edward III., within
the bounds of the royal palace, at Westminster. Sir
John had charged Sir Thomas with taking bribes from
the infidel Turks and betraying the Christian army.
The combatants were clad in armour, but their helmets
were guarded, at the visor, with small bars of steel.
Sir Thomas had taken the precaution to wear steel
knuckles, with which he soon broke the bars of steel
covering the visor of Sir John’s helmet and thus having
the advantage, he punished him so severely, by repeated
blows in the face, that Sir John was compelled
to yield. Because of the compliment paid to the English
King, in fighting this duel in his presence, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
Sir Thomas returned to France, he was tried by his
brother, the King, upon the charge of treason, and beheaded.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>The celebrated trial between the Dukes of Hereford
and Norfolk, made immortal by Shakespeare, in his
Richard II., occurred at Coventry, on September 16’,
1398. Hereford appealed the Duke of Norfolk of high
treason, in Parliament, in the use of words tending to
the king’s dishonor. Armour and coats of mail had
been procured from Germany and Milan, for the warriors.
Hereford, who was the people’s favorite, came
to the lists mounted on a white horse, barbed with blue
and green velvet. Norfolk’s horse was draped with
crimson velvet. Ten thousand armed knights were in
attendance, to prevent an affray and a large concourse
of the populace attended, to cheer their respective
favorites. When the combatants faced each other, the
King, fearful, no doubt, that Hereford would prevail,
banished both the combatants. Norfolk soon afterwards
died, in Venice, but Hereford returned the following
year to wrest the crown from the weak king and
proclaim himself King Henry IV.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>A lawyer entered the lists, in the year 1431, when
John Upton, a notary, accused John Downe of treason,
in attempting to accomplish the death of the king. The
duel was fought in the presence of the king, on the 24’
of January and the writ, providing for the barriers and
the making of the lists; the levelling and sanding of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
ground and the removal of the stones, is fully set forth
in Coke, on Littleton.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> There was a fierce fight, but
the king pardoned both contestants, before the final termination
of the trial.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>The battle between the armourer’s servant, John
Davy and his master, William Catur, described by
Shakespeare, in the second part of Henry VI., was actually
fought, on January 31’, 1447. The armourer’s
body was stripped of its armour and left upon the field
of battle and the penalty of treason was inflicted, and
the trunk was mutilated and the head set up on the
London Bridge.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The case of Thomas Whithorn, in the year 1455, reported
by William Gregory, Mayor of London, is not
without interest. Whithorn was a convicted thief and
in accordance with the custom of the period, to save his
own life, he made a number of appeals against reputable
citizens, some of whom, because of his physical
prowess, were unable to stand up against him and were
hanged, after unsuccessful trials by battle, with him.
He finally charged crime against one James Fisher,
who, to save his life, concluded to fight the thief. Both
contestants were clad in white sheep’s leather, over
their legs, head, face, hands and bodies and they fought
with green ash staves, three feet long, with an iron
ram’s horn on the end. Fisher broke his weapon early
in the fight and the constable then took the approver’s
away too and after that they fought “teeth and nail.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
Fisher finally got the thief’s nose between his teeth and
his thumbs in his eyes and he so tortured him that he
cried “craven” and was hanged, “for he was fals unto
God and unto hym.”<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>One of the last battles judicially fought upon English
soil was that between Sir James Parker and Sir Hugh
Vaughan, before Henry VII., in 1492. The battle was
the result of a quarrel about certain arms given by the
King to Vaughan. The fight occurred at Richmond
and resulted in the victory of Vaughan over Parker.
The former’s spear penetrated the helmet of Sir James
and cleaved his tongue from his mouth and he died in
a short time from the wound inflicted.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>The last trial by battle that was waged in the court
of common pleas at Westminster,<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> occurred in the
thirteenth year of Queen Elizabeth, A. D. 1571. This
was the celebrated case of Lowe vs. Paramour, reported
by Sir James Dyer<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and also by Sir Henry Spelman,<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
who was himself a witness of the trial. The battle occurred
in Tothill-fields, Westminster, “<i>non sine magna
juris consultorum perturbatione</i>,” reports Sir Henry
Spelman.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>In the last English case wherein the right of trial by
battle was recognized, two citizens of the laboring class
elected to decide their cause by the wager of battle, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
1818. The case was that of Ashford vs. Thornton.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
The facts giving rise to the appeal by Abraham Thornton,
in 1817, are briefly told. Mary Ashford, of Warwickshire,
was drowned, under circumstances directing
suspicion of foul play, against Thornton. He was arrested
for her murder and tried and acquitted by a
jury, but public sentiment was so aroused against him
that the dead girl’s brother, instituted an appeal for
murder against Thornton, and while this proceeding,
after a jury trial, was quite unusual, the court held that
the proceeding was proper. Thornton demanded the
right of trial by battle, and the court held that he was
entitled to such a trial, but before the trial, in April,
1818, the appeal was withdrawn and Thornton was discharged.
Upon the legality of the proceeding of trial
by battle, however, the case proceeded to judgment, before
the Court of King’s Bench and Lord Ellenborough,
for the court, decided that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The general law of the land is in favor of the wager
of battle and it is our duty to pronounce the law as it
is and not as we may wish it to be; whatever prejudice,
therefore, may justly exist against this mode of trial,
still, as it is the law of the land, the court must pronounce
judgment for it.”</p>

</div>

<p>That this judgment was right, few, if any, lawyers
would question, as the repeal of existing laws is a legislative,
not a judicial function; it is the province of the
courts to expound and apply, not to repeal laws regularly
enacted and recognized by the legislative branch
of government and although an absurd law may remain
unenforced, because over-looked, it is none the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
less a law, although not enforced, until repealed by the
proper department.</p>

<p>It was the judgment of the court, in the above case,
however, that brought about the repeal of the right of
trial by battle, in England, by the 59’ George III., c.
46.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> By this statute it was enacted that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Appeals of murder, treason, felony and other offenses,
and the manner of proceeding therein, have
been found to be oppressive; and the <i>trial by battle</i>, in
any suit, is a mode of trial unfit to be used; and it is
expedient that the same should be wholly abolished.”</p>

</div>

<p>Accordingly, the act proceeded to abolish all appeals,
in criminal cases and,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In any writ of right now depending, or hereafter to
be brought, the tenant shall not be received to wage
battle, nor shall issue be joined, or trial be had by
battle in any writ of right.”</p>

</div>

<p>Trial by battle was abolished in France, in 1260, by
the good Saint Louis, for the reason that it often
happened that in the contests between a rich man and a
poor man, the former hired all the champions, and left
the latter without help.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The right to a trial by battle
was last recognized, in Scotland, near the close of the
sixteenth century,<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> so it survived in England, after it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
had long ceased to exist, as a mode of judicial proceeding,
in the other European countries.</p>

<p>Trial by battle has ever been an interesting theme in
English literature. And it is little wonder that this
sturdy struggle for justice, according to the light then
obtaining, should be selected as the climax of the vivid
plots, by the masters of poesy and fiction, depicting the
chivalry of the age “when knighthood was in flower.”</p>

<p>If human interest were lacking in this antique procedure
of the past as we read of it in the unadorned details
of the trials of the period, certainly no one can
fail to entertain the deepest concern for the fate of the
principals we meet with in this struggle for justice, as
portrayed by the poets and novelists of English literature.
And instead of being overdrawn, such representations
are often but true portrayals of many of the
concrete cases that have come down to us, of the trials
by battle, of the past centuries.</p>

<p>The song of Roland, chanted at the battle of Hastings,
in the eleventh century, was really attuned to the
theme of wager by battle, and from the appeal, to the
conclusion of the duel, between Pinabel and Thierry,
before Charles the Great, resulting in the punishment
of the treason of Ganelon, for the fall of Roland, the
legal procedure of wager by battle of chivalry is truthfully
presented, even as the law writers of the period
would reproduce the history of such a trial.</p>

<p>Chaucer, in his pure and antique style, uses the trial
by battle as the expression of the chivalry and knighthood
shown by Palamon and Arcite, in their battle with
their hundred chosen warriors, before Theseus, for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
love of the beautiful Emelye, and accurately portrays
the different points of law, governing the trial by
battle, in his description of this combat, from the assembling
of the knights,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Armed for lystes, up at alle rightes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All redy to derrayne hire by bataylle,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">to the final conclusion of the trial, by the conquering of
Palamon and his knights.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>That the immortal Shakespeare was familiar with
the exact details of the procedure in trials by battle, is
apparent from a perusal of the various plays where he
introduces this method of trial.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>In King Richard II., Thomas Mowbray and Bolingbroke,
as “accuser and accused,” are introduced, in all
of their habiliments of war, into the presence of the
king, “face to face, and frowning, brow to brow.”<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>In the same play, a Lord offers the gage to the Duke
of Aumerle, in the following challenge:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Lord.</i> From sun to sun, there is my honor’s pawn;</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Engage it to the trial, if thou dar’st.”<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Duke of Surrey, is likewise made to offer battle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
in Richard II., to Lord Fitzwater, in the following
words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Surrey.</i> In proof whereof, there is my honor’s pawn,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Vernon and Bassett implore the right of trial by
battle, in 1’ Henry VI.,<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and the details of the trial by
battle between the master, Horner, and his apprentice,
Peter, are set forth, with precision, in II Henry VI.,
much as the details are given in the case from which
this scene is actually taken by the Poet.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Edgar and his bastard brother, Edmund, are made to
try their cause by the wage of battle, in King Lear, and
the rule of Knighthood, then obtaining, is adverted to,
giving the challenged one the right to decline the combat,
if the right were not equal and the wronged Edgar
truthfully asserts “Yet am I noble as the adversary, I
came to cope withal.”<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott has added the zest of human interest,
commonly felt for the innocent, wrongfully accused,
to the uncertain fate of the gentle and lovely Rebecca,
falsely accused of sorcery and witchcraft, by the valiant
and fearless, but selfish, amorous and vacillating Brian
de Bois-Guilbert, in Ivanhoe, and the trial by battle
is utilized as the instrument of justice whereby the innocence
of this gentle Jewess is established.</p>

<p>True to the faith of her fathers, and charitable, out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
of the goodness of her heart, Rebecca ministers to the
wants of the peasant and then, because she turns a
deaf ear to the importunities of the faithless Templar,
she is arraigned and tried for sorcery and the practice
of witchcraft, and would have been left without a
champion, but for the chivalrous conduct of Wilfred of
Ivanhoe, who, though sick and maimed, placed his implicit
faith in the righteousness of his cause and the
assistance of Divine aid, and the wicked de Bois-Guilbert
is stricken by a power from on high, because he
fought upon the side of an unrighteous cause.</p>

<p>From the time that Rebecca offers the gage of battle,
until the close of this interesting trial, by her tardy
champion, who hazarded his life in her defense, against
such fearful odds, in the tilt-yard of Temple stowe, we
can but see that the author of this humanly interesting
story had accurately studied the details of these trials
by battle, as given in the older books.</p>

<p>After the evidence of the witnesses to her sorcery,
had been taken, the accused demanded her right of
trial by battle, through the service of a champion, in
“respect of lawful essoine of her body.” The author
uses the exact words, given by Glanville, whereby she
invokes the preliminary delay to prepare for trial. The
herald opened the court and made announcement of the
pending issues, in the usual manner; the court was
regularly adjourned to a day certain for the trial. On
the appointed day, the details of the trial are presented,
just as such trials obtained in the courts of chivalry
and honour of the period depicted. The accused, in the
presence of the court, was interrogated, from her black
chair, placed near the funeral pile, as to her readiness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
for the combat. She begged the indulgence, which the
law granted to her, of a short delay, after invoking the
aid of Divine wisdom, for her deliverance. Her champion
appears in true knightly fashion at the last moment
and after gaining the recognition of the court, and
permission to do battle for his fair principal, he throws
the customary words of defiance into the very teeth of
the false Bois-Guilbert and the battle proceeds, until
the death of Bois-Guilbert, pronounced by the Court, in
accordance with the superstition of the times, as a consummation
devoutly to be wished, because it was, in
fact, “the judgment of God.”</p>

<p>In “The Fair Maid of Perth,” Scott also describes
the trial by battle as used to decide the destinies of the
Clan Quhele and the Clan Chattan, assisted by the volunteer
Henry Wynd, upon the field of North Inch,
whereat the whole tribe of the Clan Quhele was annihilated
in the combat with the race of the “Cat-a-Mountain.”<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>Thackeray had also studied the procedure of trial by
battle, for he introduces it into his plot in his realistic
story of “Henry Esmond” and Crockett, in his “Black
Douglas,” makes the Earl William and James Douglas,
of Avondale, enter into a legal trial by battle, just as
the law of Scotland in the fifteenth century governed
such trials.</p>

<p>But it is not the purpose of this chapter to treat extensively
of trials by battle, as presented in the literature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
of England, but only to trace the rise, growth and
decay of this mediaeval institution, as evidenced by the
law writers of the past and illustrated by the works of
poetry and fiction, portraying this ancient mode of
trial, which was superceded by the fairer method of
jury trial and with the other barbarous customs of the
dark, misty past, has faded away, with the generations
that have crept to rest, before the dawn of our modern
jurisprudence.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_233" href="#FNanchor_233" class="label">[4]</a> The Mirror (C. 3, Par. 23) states that the trial by battle was
allowable upon the warranty of the combat between the Shepard

Nicholas I. quite seriously decides this precedent to be inconclusive.
(Decret. Par. 2, Caus. 2, qu. 5, c. 22.)</p>

<p>The belief that the Deity would interfere on the side of the right,
in these combats, originated with the institution itself, for we are
told, that when King Gundobald, in the year 501, decreed the trial
by battle as an antidote to perjury, he replied to the remonstrances
of the churchmen by the argument that “The event both of national
wars and private combat is directed by the judgment of God and
Providence awards the victory to the juster cause.” (II. Gibbon, ch.
38; Esprit des Lois, book 28, ch. 17; Neilson’s Trial by Combat, p. 6.)</p>

<p>Neilson rejects the suggestion that trial by battle was divinely
instituted when David, with his Sling, slew the mighty man of
war of the Philistines, as did Pope Nicholas First, in the year 867.

<p>Some historians trace the origin of trial by battle to the fact that
perjury became so prevalent that this procedure was resorted to
to avoid the evil effects of this crime. (I. Pollock and Maitland’s
History English Law., p. 50.)</p>

<p>It is rather to be accounted for by the fact that it originated in
the customs of a warlike race, where force and superstition were
a part of the habits and customs of the people. (Lea. “Superstition
and Force,” 4 ed. p. 409.)</p>

<p>The Burgundian and Lombard rulers, in accordance with the
natural fighting tendency of their subjects, were brought to recognize
the trial by battle, because it combined the physical joy of
battle with the higher ideals of an approved formal procedure, whereby
the virtue known as justice was supposed to be attained. In
other words, the trial by battle was the natural expression of the
inclinations of both ruler and subject of the period when it was
established and crept into the established procedure of the period,
just as naturally as did the superstitions of the past centuries,—the
belief in witchcraft and ghosts,—find expression along with the
gems of literature of the same and a later period. The institution
was a product of the barbarism of the time. And trial by battle was
recognized as a form of ordeal which obtained among the warlike
German tribes from very ancient times, but it was not practiced by
the ancestors of the Anglo-Saxons. (I. Pollock and Maitland’s
History English Law, p. 51.)</p>

<p>Neilson states that private duels succeeded trial by battle, in
the 16’ and 17’ centuries, but of course trial by battle was not
abolished in England until the year 1819, and duelling had continued
for several centuries then. (Neilson’s “Trial by Combat,” pp.

<p>That Trial by Battle was introduced into England by the Normans,
is now quite generally conceded. “One ordeal the Normans recognized
which had no place in English law, namely, the ordeal of
battle.” I. Pollock and Maitland’s History Eng. Law, p. 74.</p>

<p>We find that William of Normandy, with his studious desire to preserve
English institutions and protect Englishmen, in defining the
procedure which should obtain if a Frenchman accused an Englishman,
or <i>vice versa</i>, provided that the Englishman whom a Frenchman
accused had the choice between battle and ordeal, but if the Englishman
accused the Frenchman, the former had the right to compel the
latter to join battle, or otherwise the Frenchman could swear away
the charge, with oath helpers, according to Norman law. The
Englishman was thus recognized as the Norman’s peer, but as
was not accustomed to the ordeal by battle, he was given the
choice of this procedure, if he preferred to avail himself of it, and
the Norman, by a strict rule of justice, was required to purge
himself, even though the Englishman would not fight. (Laws of
William, c. 6; Forschungen, 328; I. Pollock and Maitland’s History
English Law, pp. 89, 90.)</p>

<p>In the class of civil or criminal cases where the right of trial
by battle obtained, when the plaintiff offered battle, the defendant was
bound to accept the offer. Having offered to defend the charge
preferred against him, in legal contemplation, he volunteered to
defend it with his own body, or with the body of his freeman, “when
and where the court shall consider that defend he ought.” He then
tendered his gage and pledges to the court that on the given day
set, he would perform the task assigned to him. (Year Book, 21, 22,
II. Edw. I., pp. 9, 167; II. Pollock and Maitland’s History English
Law, pp. 610, 611.)</p>

<p>The champion, originally, was a witness and it was as such that
he intervened. In a plea for land, he testified to having seen the
seisin and that either he or his father saw the claimant in the possession
of the land. (Neilson’s “Trial by Combat,” p. 48.)</p>

<p>While hired champions were forbidden by the law, it became a
very common practice and Neilson gives many such contracts in
his interesting and thorough book, on “Trial by Combat,” pp. 48,
54.</p>

<p>Maynard’s Year Books, contain the history of many trials occurring
during the reigns of Edward III. and Henry VI. The report
of one such trial, in the year 1329, describes the champions
as appearing with shaven heads, ungirt coats, bare legged and bare
armed, tendering a glove, with a penny in each finger, to the judge,
who afterwards offered the pennies on the altar of the nearest
church, in order that “God might give the victory to him who was
in the right.” (Maynard’s Year Books, I. Henry VI., pp. 6, 7; <i>idem.</i>
21 Henry VI., pp. 19, 20.)</p>

<p>As the pugilists of the present day, have managers, who conduct
the combats between the champions for the wager of the ringside,
so men of the thirteenth century kept pugilists for hire, whose
services were quite generally used in these trials. One of these
champions was Richard of Newnham, whose master, or manager,
was William of Cookham (Note Book, pl. 185, 400, 551), whose
expert services were much in demand about the year 1220.</p>

<p>Clergymen were exempted from the trial by battle and by 41
Edward III., an appellant, on entering the field of battle could avoid
the fight, by praying his clergy. (Herbert’s “Antiquities of the Inns
of Court,” 130.)</p>

<p>By the Charter of London, the following citizens were also exempted
from trial by battle, <i>viz.</i>, <i>sexagenarii</i>, or men of three
score years; <i>coecus</i>, or those blind by accident after issue joined.
(<i>Ante idem.</i>)</p>

<p>The exemption granted by Henry I., by the Charter of London,
was followed by many other similar exemptions. Newcastle-on-Tyne,

<p>During the twelfth century, in controversies between the Lord
paramount and the tenant as to the right to the possession of real
estate, the duel or battle was a method of trial generally in vogue.
In the reign of Henry II., while the tenant, in a writ of right, had
his election to defend his title by duel, “as a royal benefit conferred
on the nation, by the prince in his clemency, by the advice
of his nobles, as an expedient whereby the lives and interests of his
subjects might be preserved, and their property and rights enjoyed
<i>without being any longer obliged to submit to the doubtful chance
of the duel</i>,” we find the institution of the <i>assize</i> guaranteed to the
subjects by the king, and this constitution is perhaps the first
guaranty of the trial by jury in the English law. (Glanv. lib. 2,
c. 4, 5, 6; I. Reeve’s History Eng. Law, pp. 393, 395.)</p>

<p>The proceeding for the recovery of land during the reign of
Henry II. and preceding reigns, is not without interest. The claim
of the demandant, or claimant, was based only upon evidence <i>de
visu et auditu</i>, or by the proof furnished by his freeman, whose
evidence was either as to what he had actually seen and knew, or
upon what his father had told him, and had enjoined upon him,
on his death-bed, by the faith that a son owed to a father, which
he was to assert, if he ever heard of any plea being urged as to
the land in controversy. (Glanv. lib. 2, c. 3.)</p>

<p>If the tenant elected to try the issue by the duel, or battle, he
could not afterwards resort to the assize, but must meet the issue
<i>de verbo in verbam</i>, as the demandant, or claimant had asserted his
title. The demandant could not be his own champion, but the
tenant could defend himself, either in person or by a champion, and
after the customary essoins, the battle proceeded. If the champion
of the demandant was conquered, the demandant lost his suit and
the champion was never again a competent witness in a duel. If
the champion of the tenant, or the tenant himself was conquered,
he lost the land with all the fruits and produce on it, and he was
never afterwards to be heard in a court of justice concerning the
same. In other words, the final effect of a trial by battle was as
conclusive as the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
and furnished the basis for a good plea of <i>res adjudicata</i> in all
subsequent controversies over the same land in the future, between
the same parties. (Glanv. lib. 2. c. 4, 5; I. Reeve’s History Eng.
Law, p. 394.)</p>

<p>Neilson complains because neither Glanville, Bracton, Britton,
nor Fleta, describe the procedure governing the actual fighting of
the duel in an English plea for land under a “writ of right.” (Neilson’s
“Trial by Combat,” p. 86.) The above description of such a
combat, is deemed accurate, from sources consulted and for the
authorities consulted, the reader is referred to Herbert’s “Antiquities
of the Inns of Courts,” pp. 115, 117.</p>

<span class="smcap">Trial by Ordeal.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Trial by ordeal was the method used to ascertain the
guilt or innocence of a person accused of crime, according
to his ability to perform certain acts, or accomplish
results which would, in the ordinary course of events,
be hurtful to him.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>If the suspected criminal was injured or killed in the
performance of the act required of him, he was adjudged
guilty, but if he performed the part assigned to
him without injury, he was declared innocent. The
tests that the suspected person was subjected to were
called ordeals,<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> or judgments of God.</p>

<p>The custom of referring disputed questions such as
the guilt or innocence of a person accused of crime, to
the judgment of God, to be determined either by lot,
or the success of certain dangerous experiments, has
existed, from the earliest times, among various widely
separated nations and peoples.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>We find that according to the “law of jealousies,”
laid down in the Mosaic code Fifteen hundred years before
Christ, the guilt of a woman, accused of infidelity,
by her husband, was determined according to this trial
of ordeal, for it is recorded:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he
be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled; or if the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of
his wife, and she be not defiled; then shall the man
bring his wife unto the priest....</p>

<p>And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say
unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if
thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness; with another,
instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter
water, that causeth the curse: ...</p>

<p>And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter
water that causeth the curse; and the water that causeth
the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter....</p>

<p>And when he hath made her to drink the water, then
it shall come to pass that, if she be defiled, and have
done trespass against her husband, that the water that
causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter,
and her belly shall swell and her thigh shall rot; and
the woman shall be a curse among her people.</p>

<p>And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean, then
shall she be free, and shall conceive seed.”<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Compurgation of accused persons, by fire, existed
among the ancient Greeks,<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and the Hindus practiced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
ordeal in nine different ways,—by the balance, by fire,
by water, by poison, by the <i>cosha</i>, or drinking water,
in which the images of the sun and other deities had
been washed, by chewing rice, by hot oil, by red hot
iron, and by drawing two images out of a jar, into
which they had been thrown.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The most generally used ordeals throughout ancient
Europe were: Trial by battle, in which the vanquished
one was adjudged guilty; trial by the ordeal of fire;
trial by water; trial by the corsned; the trial of the
eucharist; the trial by the cross and the test by judgment
of the bier.</p>

<p>In trial by battle, the accuser and accused fought
in mortal combat to determine the guilt or innocence of
the suspected person.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In the trial by fire, the accused
walked bare-footed, over red hot plow-shares, or coals
of fire,<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> carried a red hot iron in his hand, or walked
through flames, clad in a suit of wax, spread over
woolen cloth, known as the “trial of the waxen shirt,”
because if he was unhurt by the fire and the wax was
unmelted, he was considered innocent, but otherwise
was adjudged guilty.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The trial by water was either by cold or boiling
water. If the former, which was the test usually applied
to witches, the guilt was determined by the ability
of the accused to float or sink, when cast into the
water.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Where the ordeal by boiling water was used,
the accused had to take a stone out of boiling water, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
inserting his hand into a caldron, containing boiling
water, as deep as his wrist, and if the triple ordeal was
used, the boiling water was deepened so that he had to
insert his arm as far as the elbow to get the stone.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>offa execrata</i>, or corsned ordeal, a priest put
the corsned or hallowed cheese and bread, in the mouth
of the accused, with various chants and imprecations
and if he swallowed it, he was freed from the judgment,
but if it stuck in his throat, he was held to be proven
guilty of the offense with which he was charged.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The test of the eucharist was chiefly applied among
the monks and clergy, for it was believed that when
they took the test, God would smite the guilty, with
sickness or death.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In the ordeal of the cross, the accuser and accused
were placed under the cross, with their arms extended,
and the one whose hands moved first was adjudged to
be the guilty one and the other the innocent. A trial
by lot, similar to this latter ordeal, occurred when the
accused was placed before certain relics with two dice
before him, one of which was marked with a cross. If
the cross was selected, at hazard, he was acquitted, but
otherwise was adjudged guilty.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>And finally, the ordeal known as the judgment of the
bier was used to determine the guilt of the accused,
under a charge of murder. The deceased, supposed to
have been murdered, was placed upon a bier, and the
accused was made to touch his body. If blood flowed,
or foam appeared in the mouth of the murdered person,
or the body changed position, the accused was adjudged
guilty of the murder, but if none of these signs appeared,
he was acquitted.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>According to the Institute of Narada,<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the ordeal
was used four or five centuries before Christ, in India,
for we find that the balance, fire, water, poison and the
sacred libation, were considered the five divine tests,
for determining the guilt or innocence of suspected persons.</p>

<p>From the formulas given in the Institute of Narada,
the most solemn ceremonies accompanied the application
of the tests used in the trials by ordeal, in India, in
ancient days. In describing the different tests, it is said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Having adjured the balance by imprecation, the
judge should cause the accused to be placed in the
balance again. ‘O balance, thou only knowest what
mortals do not comprehend. This man, being arraigned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
in a cause, is weighed upon thee. Therefore mayst
thou deliver him lawfully from his perplexity.’ ...
If the individual increased in weight, he was adjudged
guilty; if he was found to be lighter or equal
in weight, his innocence was established.</p>

<p>In the ordeal of fire, the judge thus addressed the
fire: ‘Thou, O fire, dwellest in the interior of all creatures,
like a witness. Thou only knowest what mortals
do not comprehend. This man is arraigned in a cause
and desires acquittal. Therefore, mayst thou deliver
him lawfully from his perplexity.’ ... Seven
circles of fire, with a diameter of a foot each and thirty-two
inches distant from each other were marked on the
ground, and the man, having fasted and cleansed himself,
has seven <i>acvattha</i> leaves fastened on his hands
and he takes a smooth ball of red hot iron in his hands
and walks slowly through the seven circles of fire and
deposits the ball on the ground. If he is burnt, he is
adjudged guilty, but if he is unburnt, he is declared innocent.</p>

<p>In the ordeal of water, the judge adjures the water,
as in the preceding tests, by the balance and by fire,
and the accused wades into water to his waist, while
another shoots an arrow. The accused dives into the
water and if he remains under while a swift runner returns
the arrow, he is innocent, but otherwise is adjudged
guilty.</p>

<p>In the poison ordeal, after the selection of the particular
poison the judge thus adjures the poison: ‘Thou,
O poison, art the son of Brahma,<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> thou are persistent
in truth and justice; relieve this man from sin and by
thy virture become an ambrosia to him. On account of
thy venomous and dangerous nature, thou art the destruction
of all living creatures; thou art destined to
show the difference between right and wrong, like a
witness.’ The accused person eats the poison and if it
easily digested, without violent symptoms, the king<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
shall recognize him as innocent, and dismiss him, after
having honored him, with presents.</p>

<p>In the ordeal of sacred libation, the judge should give
the accused water in which an image of that deity to
whom he is devoted, has been bathed, thrice calling out
the charge, with composure. One to whom any misfortune
or calamity happens, within a week, or a fortnight,
is proved to be guilty.”<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Charlemagne apparently did not place much dependence
in the <i>judicium Dei</i>, by means of the ordeal, at the
beginning of his reign, for in 779, by his edict the trial
by ordeal was to be used in the more trifling offenses,
while cases of greater magnitude were to be tried by the
civil law of the realm.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Later on in his reign, however, by his edicts of the
year 806 and 809 this monarch seems to have come to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
regard the ordeal with much greater favor, for he frequently
referred to this method of trial; when dividing
up his empire between his sons he directed that all disputes
should be settled by ordeal, and endeavored to
force a greater regard for the judgments in trials by
ordeal, on the part of the subjects, whom, it seems,
had come to entertain his own early distrust in this
species of trials.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>It seems that Charlemagne completely believed in
the efficacy of the ordeal, by the year 794, for we are
told that in this year, a certain Bishop Peter, who was
condemned by the Synod of Frankfort to clear himself
of the suspicion of complicity in a conspiracy of treason
against Charlemagne, being unable to obtain conjurators,
one of his vassals offered to attempt the test of
the ordeal, as his proxy, and on his success, the Bishop
was adjudged innocent of the charge and was reinstated.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Soon after the death of Charlemagne, in the year
816, Louis-le-Debonnaire, at the Council of Aix-la-Chapelle,
prohibited the continuance of the ordeal of the
cross,<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> because it had a tendency to bring the Christian
symbol into contempt and his son, the Emperor Lothair
also issued a similar edict against the use of this ordeal,
after he assumed the reigns of government.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Among the early Saxons, the ordeals by fire and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
water were practiced, for we find that the <i>ordale</i> signified
<i>judicium aequum, justum, indifferens</i>, “an upright,
just and indifferent judgment.”<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Tacitus tells us that the ancestors of our Saxon forefathers,
during pagan times, were addicted to divination
and risked certain results upon the flying of birds,
the neighing of horse and trial by combat.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> And
trial by ordeal was used by them in both civil and criminal
cases, to determine the issues later solved by the
testimony of witnesses, or the oaths of compurgators.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The ordeal of hot water appears in the laws of Ine,<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
who began his reign in the year 710, and the ordeals by
fire and water had become so common by the time of
King Athelstan, that we find the procedure governing
such trial, fully covered by his Constitutions,<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> by
which they were considered in the light of religious
ceremonies:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Concerning ordeal, we command, in the name of
God, and by the precept of our archbishops and bishops,
that no man enter into the church after the fire is
brought in, wherewith the judgment is to be made hot,
except the priest, and he who is to undergo the trial;
and let there be measured nine feet from the stake unto
the mark, according to the measure of the foot, who is
to come thus to judgment.</p>

<p>And if the trial be by water, let it be made hot, till it
boil, in a vessel of iron, brass, lead, or clay; and if it
be single, let his hand be put therein after a stone or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
stock up to his wrist; but if the accusation be threefold,
then to his elbow; and when the judgment shall be prepared,
let two men be brought in on either side, to make
experiment, that it be as hot as is afore expressed.</p>

<p>Let as many also come in on each side the judgment,
along the church; and let them be fasting and abstain
from their wives that night; and the priest shall
sprinkle holy water on them, and give them the text of
the holy gospel to kiss, as also the sign of the cross;
and no man shall make the fire any longer than whilst
the benediction beginneth, but shall cast the iron upon
the coals until the last collect; afterwards it shall be put
upon the <i>ceac</i> (cauldron)<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> without any more words,
then that they pray earnestly to God that he will vouch
safe to manifest the truth therein; then shall the person
accused drink holy water and his hand wherewith he
shall carry the judgment shall be sprinkled therewith;
and so let him go, the nine feet measured being distinguished
by three and three.</p>

<p>At the first mark next to the stake, he shall set his
right foot and at the second his left foot; and thence he
shall remove his right foot unto the third mark, where
he shall throw down the iron and hasten to the holy altar;
which done, his hand shall be sealed up, and the
third day after viewed, whether it be clean or unclean
where it was so sealed. And he who shall transgress
these laws, let the ordeal judgment or trial be done
upon him, that he pay 120 s. for a fine or mulct.”<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

</div>

<p>For three days before the trial, the accused was to
attend the priest, to be constant at mass, to make his
offering and in the interim, to sustain himself on nothing
but bread, salt, water and onions. On the day of
the trial he was to take the sacrament and swear he was
not guilty of the crime imputed to him. The accuser
and accused both came to the place of trial, with not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
more than twelve persons each, to stay any interposition
or violence and the accuser then renewed his charge
upon oath and the accused made his purgation on oath
also. If the ordeal was by hot water, he put his wrist
or arm into the boiling water, accordingly whether it
was the simple or triple test, and if the trial was by
cold water, his thumbs were tied to his toes and he was
cast into the water. If he escaped the boiling water unhurt,
or sank in the cold water, he was adjudged innocent,
but if he was burned by the hot water, or swam in
the cold water, he was adjudged guilty, as charged by
his accuser.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>These trials by water and fire were called <i>judicium
Dei</i>, or, as the Mirror of Justice puts it, miracles of
God, but “Christianity suffered not that they be by such
wicked arts cleared, if one may otherwise avoid it.”<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>From this observation in the Mirror, it has been contended
that the Anglo-Saxons distinguished between
open and manifest offenses and those not so public as
to be susceptible of proof and that trial by ordeal was
only used in the latter class of crimes.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>It is true that in Alfred’s time there were trials by
jury, and it seems that trial by ordeal may have been
re-established, after trial by jury, in doubtful cases,
as a refuge or solution of an otherwise doughty problem
for the barbarian mind to solve.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>Pursuance to the terms of a certain league, made between
Edward the Elder and Guthrun, the Dane, ordeals
were forbidden upon festivals or fasting days<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
and the same provision was inserted in the constitution
made by the synod held at Eanham, under King Ethelred.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The laws of Canute and Edward the Confessor also
contained provisions forbidding trials by ordeal upon
festivals or fasting days, for we read that the <i>judicium
Dei</i>, upon these auspicious occasions, was to be postponed,
until the affairs of mortals could be better arranged
for its reception, by the following provision:<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We forbid ordeals and oaths” (the name law trials
at that time were called) “on feast days and ember
days, and from the advent of our Lord till the eighth
day after twelfth be past; and from Septuagesima till
fifteen nights after Easter. And the sages have ordained
that St. Edward’s day shall be festival all England
on the fifteenth cal. of April, and St. Dunstan’s,
on the fourteenth cal. of June; and that all Christians,
as right it is, should keep them hallowed and in peace.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the simple ordeal, of the Anglo-Saxons, the hot
iron weighed one pound and in the triple ordeal, it was
to weigh three pounds. The triple ordeal was used in
the crimes of arson and murder, treason and forgery.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>In the laws of Edward the Elder, perhaps the earliest
reference in Anglo-Saxon laws, to the ordeal, it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
provided that perjured persons, or those once convicted
should not thereafter be deemed oath-worthy, but
on their accusation, should be hurried to the ordeal,<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
and similar provisions are to be found in the laws of
Ethelred, Cnut and Henry I.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Trial by ordeal at first carried with it the sanction of
the priest, as well as the civil power and the clergy continued
to approve and interject the spiritual portion of
the proceeding, until the early portion of the thirteenth
century.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Under the law of William the Conqueror,
the conduct of the ordeal, as a known ecclesiastical procedure,
was declared to be the business of the bishop,
but the civil and spiritual powers were to co-operate
harmoniously, in the trial by ordeal, the court of the
hundred making the original order by which a man was
sent to the ordeal of fire or water, but the bishop presided
at the ceremony and regulated the course of the
proceeding, in accordance with the solemn religious
ceremony, whereby the element used was blessed and
the Divine Wisdom of Omnipotence was invoked to the
conclusion of the whole proceeding.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The Normans were attached to the procedure, elsewhere
discussed, as the <i>trial by battle</i> and they did not
relish a procedure which seemed to them to be a mere
superstitious formality, fit only for women and old
or maimed men. However, ever since the reign of Ina,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
the Saxons had been accustomed to the ordeal and the
laws of Ina and later monarchs continued in effect, and
the accused person was entitled to select the ordeal of
hot iron, or that of hot water and to undergo, under the
supervision of the priest or bishop, a trial, to determine
his guilt or innocence of the offense charged.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1166, in the Assize of Clarendon, and
again in the year 1176, in the Assize of Northampton,
Henry II. provided for a public mode of accusation for
the capital felonies and trial by ordeal was the method
of procedure fixed to determine the guilt or innocence
of the person charged.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Prior to the thirteenth century perjury was so common
and it was so impossible to avoid the effects of a
false oath, by the proceedings of men, that the Laws of
Henry provided that “No one is to be convicted of a
capital crime by testimony.”<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Mere human testimony
was not enough to send a man to the gallows, but one
accused of a capital offense was to be entitled to one
of the old-world sacred processes, wherein the <i>judicium
Dei</i>, was supposed to take the place of the false standards,
too often erected by ordinary mortals. The ordeal
was then so far “the law of the land” that one
accused of a capital offense, who refused the ordeal,
could be executed, as an outlaw, because he had thus
defied the law of the realm. But one who had not been
accorded this “law of the land,” based upon the sacred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
and Divine belief in the infallibility of the test of ordeal,
could not legally be condemned, as trial by jury
or by the oaths of witnesses was not yet an accredited
method of procedure in cases of capital offense.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Glanville tells us that in his time, about the year 1187,
an accused person, who was so far disabled by mayhem
that he could not test his guilt or innocence by the ordeal
of battle, was entitled to the ordeal of fire or water,
to determine his guilt or innocence, this author of the
first law book observing:<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In such case, the Accused is obliged to purge himself
by the Ordeal, that is, by the hot Iron, if he be a
free Man—by water, if he be a Rustic.”</p>

</div>

<p>This corresponds with the statement elsewhere made,
that in the early use of this trial, the hot iron ordeal,
was confined to the nobility, or patricians, while the
water ordeal was generally used among the common
people, accused of minor offenses or other than the
capital felonies.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>By the latter part of the twelfth century, the ordeal
had become so discredited, in the time of Henry II. that
the law of that reign provided that any one charged before
the king’s justices with the crime of murder, theft,
robbery, or the receipt of such offenders, or of arson,
or forgery, by the oaths of twelve knights of the
hundred, or of twelve free and lawful men, in the absence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
of such knights, should submit to the water ordeal,
and if he failed in the experiment, he should lose
one foot; and this law afterwards amended, at Northampton
in order to make the punishment more severe
and the felon also lost his right hand, as well as one of
his feet. He was also required to abjure the realm, within
forty days and even though he was acquitted by the
water ordeal, he was required to find pledges to answer
for his good behavior, and if he were later charged with
murder, or other felony, he was then required to abjure
the realm within the forty days, with all his goods, save
what his lord might distrain to discharge his obligations
due him.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> This law was to remain in effect, as
long as the king pleased and the effect of this law was
that the accused, if convicted, lost a limb and suffered
banishment and even if acquitted, by ordeal, he was
likewise banished, for such was the doubt then entertained
as to the justness of the trial by ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>This doubt upon the justness of the trial by ordeal,
was due, in large measure to the fact that many such
trials were fraudulently managed, by the Bishops, to
bring about the acquittal of the accused.</p>

<p>It is related that William Rufus, who had caused
fifty Englishmen of good family, to be tried by ordeal
for the violation of some law of the realm, after their
acquittal by the ordeal of the hot iron, declared that he
would try them again by the judgment of his court
and would not abide by this pretended judgment of
God, “which was made favorable or unfavorable, at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
any man’s pleasure.”<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> And Henry II., likewise convinced
of the fraud accompanying such acquittals, by
this means, also refused to give final effect to such acquittals.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Trial by ordeal continued in England until the judgments
of councils, in the reign of Henry III., but in the
third year of the reign of this monarch on January 27’,
1219, direction was given to the justices itinerant for
the northern counties of the kingdom not to try persons
charged with murder, arson, robbery, theft or other
felonies, by the ordeals of fire or water, but for the
present, until further provision could be made, to keep
them in prison, <i>so as not to endanger their life or limb</i><a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
and those charged with the inferior offenses were to be
compelled to abjure the realm.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>This order of council, during the reign of Henry III.,
had such a potent influence toward abolishing the superstitious
trial of ordeal, that it went quite out of use by
the time of Bracton, who makes no mention of it in his
book.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>Compurgation by witnesses was substituted, in England
in the early part of the thirteenth century, for the
former mode of compurgation by ordeal and the latter
became an obsolete procedure in England, until revived
in the crime of witchcraft, by James I., where it was
quite generally used, to determine the guilt or innocence
of persons accused of sorcery, because of the absence
of any other test to apply, to determine their guilt
or innocence.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> This superstitious monarch maintained
that trial by ordeal was an infallible test in cases of
witchcraft, because the pure elements of fire and water
would not receive those who had renounced the sacred
privileges of their baptism and by his authority and example
thousands of cases of cruelty and oppression resulted,
in the use of the ordeal, as applied to cases of
sorcery, during the craze of that delusion, in Europe,<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
but otherwise, the trial by ordeal passed into history,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
along with the many other cruel institutions of a past
age.</p>

<p>The ordeal was frequently used, in ancient Europe,
to establish the paternity of children or the chastity of
women, the success or failure of the test being generally
accepted as the judgment of God.</p>

<p>In 887 Charles-le-Gros accused his wife, the Empress
Richarda, of adultery with Bishop Liutward, and she
offered to prove her innocence by the judicial combat,
or the ordeal of the red-hot iron.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>St. Cunigundi, referred to as the “virgin-wife” of
the Emperor St. Henry II., is also reported to have
eagerly appealed to the judgment of God, to establish
her innocence of the baseless charge of infidelity, preferred
against her by her jealous lord, and in vindication
of her honor, to have successfully trod, unharmed,
the red-hot plow-shares.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>In the eleventh century, the unholy purpose of Edward
the Confessor—who was himself too ascetic to
make his own wife, Editha, the partner of his bed<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>—in
his desire to accomplish the death of his own Mother,
Queen Emma, because of her partiality to his half
brother, Hardicanute—the son of Canute,—was frustrated
by the Queen invoking this judgment of God,
through the ordeal of the red-hot iron, to establish her
innocence of the charge of adultery with Alwyn, the
Bishop of Winchester. The Queen triumphantly
purged both herself and the Bishop, by the help of St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
Sowthin, by walking bare-footed over nine red-hot
plow-shares and out of gratitude for this vindication,
the Queen and the Bishop each gave nine manors to
the Church of Winchester in memory of the nine plow-shares,
and it is reported that the King, for preferring
the false charge against them, was corrected with
stripes.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The Confessor was more successful in ridding himself
of his father-in-law, however, and the interesting
case of Godwin, Duke of Kent, father of Harold and
sometimes called the “King maker of England,” during
the reign of Edward the Confessor, also illustrates
the superstitious belief in the corsned ordeal.</p>

<p>As the story goes, Duke Godwin was dining with his
royal son-in-law Edward the Confessor—for the latter
had then married his daughter Editha—and whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
premeditated or not, the King repeated the accusation
that his brother Alfred had met his death at the hands
of Duke Godwin. To vindicate himself old Godwin
then invoked the ordeal of the corsned and seizing a
morsel of bread he dramatically exclaimed: “May God
cause this bread to choke me if I am guilty in thought
or in deed of this crime.” Then the King took the
bread and blessed it, and, whether he poisoned it or
not, when Godwin put it in his mouth and swallowed
it, he was suffocated by it and fell down dead.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>In this age of scepticism it is hard to accept this
superstitious explanation for the end of old Duke Godwin,
but the secret of his death is more reasonably accounted
for, on the theory of Boccascio’s story of Calen
Drino, where the expected miracle was brought about
by the secret mixture of aloes in the bread of the corsned,
for, as Lea suggests, Edward the Confessor, both
because of his dislike for his father-in-law, and his desire
to cast off the tutelage in which he was held, in
order to further his self interest and rid himself of a
hated enemy, would no doubt have secretly mixed
poison with the corsned used in this ordeal and then
caused the story to be circulated among the superstitious
subjects, to account for the Duke’s sudden demise.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>We find that the ordeal was utilized in France, in the
tenth century in the notable case of Teutberga, the
wife of King Lothair, great-grandson of Charlemagne.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
Desiring to rid himself of his wife, this degenerate
grandson of a worthy grand-sire, accused her of incest
and forced her to a confession. She afterwards recanted
and denied the truth of her confession and
offered to establish her innocence by the ordeal of hot
water, by proxy.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Hincmar, the most distinguished divine of this period
championed the cause of the unfortunate queen and
wrote a dissertation upon the infallibility of the test of
the ordeals, because they had the guidance of the Divine
Wisdom, effectually convincing himself and a
large number of the French subjects of the correctness
of the judgment by this ordeal, especially when King
Lothair so far estopped himself from claiming that he
had not desired to get rid of his wife, by espousing his
concubine, Waldrada, whom he had, in fact, preferred
to the wife he had discredited by the criminal charge
against her.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Illustrating the prevalence with which the pagan
practice of ordeal had taken possession of the minds of
the churchmen of the ninth century, Lea quotes the
argument of Hincmar, in his interesting work, “Superstition
and Force,”<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In boiling in water the guilty are scalded and the
innocent are unhurt, because Lot escaped unharmed
from the fire of Sodom, and the future fire which will
precede the terrible judge, will be harmless to the
saints, and will burn the wicked as in the Babylonian
furnace of old.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>Of course the correctness of this syllogism, depends
upon the correctness of the first assumption, based upon
the delusions and superstitions of a past age, but
the conclusion seemed to satisfy a large number of that
day, judged by the standards then obtaining, among
which was the idea of a Deity who was a bigger,
stronger, crueler man—a more “terrible judge.”</p>

<p>Some few of the many interesting trials by ordeal,
which obtained during the twelfth century in the reigns
of Richard I. and King John, have been reproduced by
Sir F. Palgrave, in his “Proofs and Illustrations,” to
be found in the <i>Rotuli Curiae Regis</i><a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> for those reigns.
Let us examine a few of these old Rolls.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Roll of the Iter of Wiltshire, 10 Richard I.</i>—The
jurors say that Radulphus Parmentarius was found
dead with his neck broken, and they suspect one Christina,
who was formerly the wife of Ernaldus de
Knabbewell, of his death, because Radulphus sued
Christina in the ecclesiastical court for breach of a
promise of marriage she had made to him and after the
death of her husband Ernaldus, Reginald, a clerk, frequented
her and took her away from Radulphus, and
Reginald and Christina hated Radulphus for sueing
her, and on account of that hatred, the jurors suspect
her and the clerk of his death. And the country says
it suspects her. Therefore, it is considered that the
clerk and Christina appear on Friday, and that Christina
purge herself by fire.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> <i>Roll of the Iter of Stafford,
in 5 John.</i>—One Elena is suspected by the jurors,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
because she was at the place where Rainalda de Henchenhe
was killed and because she was killed by her help
and consent. She denies it. Let her purge herself by
the judgment of fire; but as she is ill, let her be respited,
till she gets well.</p>

<p>Andrew of Bureweston is suspected by the jurors of
the death of one Hervicus, because he fled for his death,
therefore let him purge himself by the judgment of
water.”<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

</div>

<p>During the witchcraft craze, in Europe, the ordeal of
fire and water was frequently invoked by the accused
persons, to clear themselves of the charge, but so incensed
were the people against those arraigned for this
offense that it was difficult to convince the courts and
juries of the innocence of the alleged offender, even by
this supposed infallible test of the judgment of God. It
was presumed that the Devil interfered with the correctness
of the termination of the tests in this hated
crime and so the poor suspects were condemned, after
suffering untold tortures, even though the test of the
ordeal favored their innocence of the charge.</p>

<p>The Inquisitor Sprenger cites the case of a witch,
tried before the Count of Furstenberg, in 1484. The
accused invoked the test of the red-hot iron and the
Inquisitor attributed his acquiescence to his youth and
inexperience and the fact that he was not acquainted
with the methods of the Devil, to further the cause of
the sorcerers. Although sentenced to carry the hot
iron only six paces, the supposed witch carried it six
paces and offered to hold it still longer, if required, as
she displayed her hand wholly uninjured. The Count<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
was thus compelled to render a judgment of not guilty
against the accused person and at the time Sprenger
wrote, in 1487, he reported that she still lived “to the
scandal of the faithful.”<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The superstition connected with the trial by ordeal,
as a means of detecting the guilt or innocence of the
participants of the foul crimes of the middle ages, early
took a firm hold of the popular imagination and we find
repeated references to the ordeal, in the dramatic and
popular literature of the different countries where this
mode of trial obtained.</p>

<p>The heroic Iceland song of the Elder Edda, supposed
to have been composed between the sixth and eighth
centuries, utilizes the ordeal as a means of bringing
to justice the false witness borne by the accuser, the
Concubine Herkia, in her charge of adultery against
Gudrun, the wife of Atli.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> First describing the test,
resulting in the innocence of Gudrun, and then the
proof of the guilt of her accuser, the poem proceeds:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>The ordeal of the bier was exemplified in the current
literature of the age of Richard Coeur-de-Lion, for the
histories of that King report that when he met the
funeral procession of his father Henry II., at Fontevraud,
the blood spurted from the nose of the deceased,
because of the treason and rebellion of which his son
had been guilty.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>Shakespeare utilizes this story of Richard Coeur-de-Lion,
in the funeral scene, in Richard III., where Lady
Anne, when interrupted in her grief at the bier of
Henry VI., is made to say to the by-standers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O gentlemen, see, see: dead Henry’s wounds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Open their congeal’d mouths, and bleed afresh.”<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Sir Walter Scott’s “Minstrelsy of the Scottish
Border” we also find a reference to this ordeal of the
bier, when, in the ballad of Earl Richard, this author
established the innocence of the maid, by this test:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Put na the wite on me,’ she said;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘It was my may Katherine.’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then they hae cut baith fern and thorn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To burn that maiden in.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">It wadna take upon her cheik,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor yet upon her chin;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor yet upon her yellow hair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To cleanse that deadly sin.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The maiden touched that clay-cauld corpse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A drap it never bled;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ladye laid her hand on him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And soon the ground was red.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>And thus Scott uses the ordeal of the bier to establish
that the accuser was herself the guilty person<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and the
Bard of Avon and the Elder Edda utilize this ordeal
and that of the boiling water, to demonstrate the infallibility
of this Divine test, when applied, to ascertain
the guilt or innocence of one accused of such crimes
as may legitimately be the subject of this character of
proceeding, known to the ancient law as one of the
Judgments of God.</p>

<p>The ordeal was entirely a judicial proceeding, regularly
used, in an early day, for the trial of criminal
cases, before the civil and ecclesiastical courts. The
accused had no alternative but to undergo the trial by
ordeal, for when ordered to submit to it, the order had
the force and effect of a regular judgment of the
court.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> A failure to comply with the order of the
court to undergo a trial by ordeal, was treated as a contempt
of court, and under the early English law, the
accused who refused to submit to such a test, was outlawed
and his property was confiscated, the same as if
he had been adjudged guilty of the offense, for in refusing
a compliance with the mandate of the law, he
placed himself beyond the pale of the law and later
could not claim the right to a lawful trial.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The Anglo-Saxon
codes allowed no alternative but contained direct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
and specific provisions for the trial by ordeal, in
all its different phases.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>The circumstances and conditions under which ordeal
was employed, in the trial of the various felonies known
to the early Saxon laws, varies, necessarily, with the
customs and legislation of the different rulers, and
sometimes we find that the right of selection obtained,
between this and other modes of compurgation, or between
the different forms of ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Little, if any good, could result from a discussion of
the power of a Court to order submission to such barbarous
treatment, for the courts assumed the power
and it was backed-up with the influence of the Church
and the authority of the King. The citizens could do
little else than submit to such a formidable alliance,
which proceeded in the name of the Majesty of the Law
and the Solemn Assurance of the Church, for there
were no constitutions to protect the citizens from cruel
or unusual punishments; might was right when used
against the weak and oppressed and the power of the
Church and State was too much for any individual to
overcome. Society was not organized, as at present,
to protect the rights of the individual, but the Church
and State were all-powerful and their orders had the
force to overcome all private resistance.</p>

<p>As shown, in the beginning, the institution known
as trial by ordeal, like many other of the cruel customs
of the ancient world, had the Mosaic law as its foundation
and the Church’s approval, in the construction of
the foundation and the recognition of the whole institution.
The Church was not only ready to accept the barbarous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
practices of its pagan converts but itself gave
them fresh claim to confidence, by throwing around
them the solemn ceremonies of its own approval. The
ordeals were all conducted with the aid of the priests,
and prelates in all the Catholic countries were everywhere
granting special charters authorizing the privilege
of trials by ordeals.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>But as the Church was partly responsible for the
practice of trials by ordeal, because the Churchmen
were but human and, as such, entered into the manners
and customs of the people of the period when they
lived, the Church had no inconsequential part in abolishing
this barbarous custom, for ever since the sixth
century and perhaps from the beginning of the custom,
eminent Churchmen had opposed the institution as a
pagan custom, not authorized by the teachings of the
ancient Jews or the religion of Christ, and finally, the
protests of these wise Churchmen culminated in the
suppression of this old test, and in 1215 the Lateran
Council forbade the clergy from afterward taking part
in the ceremony known as trial by ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> And Henry III.,
following the lead made by the Church, “Seeing
that the judgment of fire and water is forbidden by the
Church of Rome,” directed his judges, starting on their
circuits, to adopt other methods of proof and to forever
discard this brutal test.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>If the Church was remiss in its duty to oppose the
ordeal, therefore, in the beginning, it brought about the
repression of the practice, and is, at least, entitled to
the benefit of the approval of the friends of humanity
for this tardy beneficence, upon its part.</p>

<p>If true that every age, like every person, has its own
sins and short-comings to answer for, and that is the
happiest which best succeeds in hiding them for a
time,<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> then the age of the trial by ordeal, according to
our twentieth century standard, was guilty of a sin that
the past centuries must atone for, if atonement is essential
for the wayward customs of a pagan race,
struggling without compass or needle, amid the darkness
of a barbarous age, to steer a straight course.
They should not be held to more than the ordinary
standards of right and wrong then prevailing, in their
efforts to find the higher law for society, when just
able to attempt to clamber up the mountain heights of
wisdom. The inhabitants of the centuries who utilized
the trial by ordeal had not then perfected their judicial
system so that very high ideals of individual right obtained,
but they had made wonderful strides in the
arts and sciences, while practicing this hideous custom
of trusting to the wisdom of God, in the trials of men
and women for their offenses against society, as judged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
by man made laws. We have elevated the standards of
the judicial system somewhat, since that period, but in
our own time, a large number of people, instead of further
establishing the independence of the judiciary, are
favorable to submitting to popular vote, the correctness
of a given decision, or the judicial fitness of a judge;
mormonism only recently was abolished and instead of
the superstition and delusion which invoked the judgment
of God in trials of witches and others accused of
unproven crimes, we have spiritualism and other similar
protests against rationalism and reason, so we are
not yet in a position to condemn, in unmeasured terms,
our older brothers of the day of trials by ordeal.</p>

<p>From the fragments of the Avesta, which have come down to
us, containing snatches of the prehistoric law of the ancient Persians,
the ordeal of boiling water was a fixed, settled legal procedure, at
that distant day, for it is there recorded:</p>

<p>“Creator: he who knowingly approaches the hot, golden, boiling
water, as if speaking truth, but lying to Mithra;</p>

<p>What is the punishment for it?</p>

<p>Then answered Ahura-Mazda: Let them strike seven hundred
blows with the horse goad, seven hundred with the craesho-charaha.”
This was the punishment affixed for using this particular ordeal
for fraudulent purposes, just as if one trifled with one of the settled
legal processes of the present day and as perjury was then
prevalent, the punishment of twice seven hundred blows to the
perjurer, was the penalty for using this ordeal to further perjury,
or false swearing. Vendidad, Farg. IV., 156; “Records of the Past,”

<p>The Lateran Council of 1215 forbade the clergy to take part in
the ceremony of the ordeal any further and in prompt obedience
to this decree in England, Henry III. abolished it in the kingdom,
as England was then at the Pope’s feet, and aside from the cases
of witchcraft and sorcery, in the reign of James I., the ordeal last
appears, as a method of judicial trial, in the old rolls of the reign
of King John. (Concil. Lateran. IV., c. 18; Foedera, i, 154; Rolls

<p>It seems that the charges against Queen Emma were preferred
by Robert, Archbishop of Canterbury. She was accused both of
consenting to the death of her son, Alfred, and of preparing poison
for her son Edward, the Confessor, and also of intimacy with Alwyn,
the Bishop of Winchester. The Dowager Queen, on the night preceding
the trial, prayed for help, in the Abbey of St. Swithune, at
Winchester and the next day she passed over the nine plow-shares
unhurt. Archbishop Robert fled the kingdom and the King, who
had brought about her trial, did penance for his credulity.</p>

<p>Illustrative of the approval of the church of Rome in the ancient
procedure by ordeal, we find, in the ninth century that Hincmar
expatiated upon the blessing of such a test, in that it combines
“The elements of water and of fire: the one representing the
deluge—the judgment inflicted on the wicked of old; the other
authorized by the fiery doom of the future—the day of judgment,
in both of which we see the righteous escape and the wicked suffer.”

</div>

<p><i>Peine forte et dure</i>,<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or, the “strong and hard pain,”
as it was most appropriately termed, was the name given
in Europe to the particular kind of punishment formerly
inflicted upon a prisoner, charged with felony,
where he stood mute and refused to answer on his
arraignment, or having entered his plea of not guilty,
where he peremptorily challenged more than twenty
jurors, which was quite generally considered a contumacy
equivalent to standing mute.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Generally, in indictments for high treason and the
lower felonies and misdemeanors, standing mute was
held equivalent to a conviction and the prisoner was
sentenced and received his punishment, just as if he had
entered a plea of guilty or suffered a conviction. But in
all other felonies the prisoner was required to plead
to the indictment, before a conviction could be obtained
and if he obstinately stood mute, or refused to plead,
he was subjected to the <i>peine forte et dure</i>, a judgment
purposely ordained to be exquisitely severe, that by that
very means it might rarely be put into execution.</p>

<p>The judgment for standing mute, was: That the
prisoner be remanded to the prison from whence he
came, and put into a low, dark chamber, and there be
laid on his back, on the bare floor, naked, unless where
decency forbids; that there be placed upon his body<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
as great a weight of iron as he can bear; and more,
that he have no sustenance, save only, on the first day,
three morsels of the worst bread; and on the second day
three draughts of standing water, that should be nearest
to the prison door; and in this condition, this should be
alternately his daily diet, until he answers to the indictment.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>To understand how such an inhuman institution as
that of pressing prisoners to death came into existence,
it is necessary to understand somewhat the history of
criminal proceedings of the period when it obtained.
The motive which would induce the prisoner charged
with felony to submit to this terrible punishment, rather
than enter his plea, was no doubt to escape the attainder
which would result from a conviction for felony. If
he was convicted of felony, his goods were forfeited to
the crown and in the case of capital felony, corruption
of blood followed attainder and the felon could neither
inherit nor transmit landed property.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Where the prisoner
had heirs, therefore, and possessed any estate, his
attachment and affection for his heirs or children frequently
prompted him to suffer the punishment of being
pressed to death, to avoid the attainder of his name
and the corruption of his blood, for death and attainder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
would both result from the conviction, which was frequently
certain to result, in any event.</p>

<p>Trial by ordeal obtained in England until the thirteenth
century,<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and as a part of the procedure obtaining
when this barbarous custom prevailed the prisoner
when asked “Culprit, how will you be tried,” replied,
“By God,” meaning that he would be tried by ordeal,
rather than “By my country,” which was the request
for a jury trial. When the prisoner stood mute and
refused to plead, the court was so perplexed that frequently
the prisoner would escape by some trivial
punishment, as the procedure of the period did not include
this kind of a case, so the astute criminal lawyers
of these times no doubt frequently practiced this
subterfuge to perplex the court and secure the escape
of a guilty client. Legal forms at this period had much
greater efficacy than at present when we have statutes
of jeofails and look to the substance, rather than the
forms of things, and it was unheard of then to try a
prisoner by ordeal, before he entered his plea, or even
to put him upon his country, so where he stood mute,
the difficult thing was to secure his consent to try him
by either method.</p>

<p>Under the stress of the perplexity of having found
concrete cases not covered by the custom and practice
of the period, the judges instantly ordered some of the
offenders standing mute on malice, to be put to death,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
for refusing to consent to be tried, according to the
custom of the realm, but this was practically judicial
murder, as the defendant had not been legally convicted,
before sentence, so the pendulum of public sentiment
swung back from this precedent and brought about
a great revulsion to this practice.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the thirteenth century the penalty
for refusing to plead consisted merely of a severe
punishment, with low diet, until the obstinacy was
overcome, and latterly, the practice prevailed, which
had no legal sanction, of tying the thumbs together,
with whipcord, that the pain might induce the prisoner
to plead.</p>

<p>During the reign of Edward I., in the year 1275,
in the proceedings of the Parliament of Westminster,
the first mention is made of this punishment for standing
mute through obstinacy or wilfullness. It was enacted
by this statute that felons refusing to plead
through obstinacy should be confined in the prison, <i>forte
et dure</i>. They were to go “barefooted and bareheaded,
in their coat only, in prison, upon the bare ground continually,
night and day, fastened down with irons,”
only eating and drinking on alternate days, until the
plea was entered.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But the courts could not wait for
the obstinate prisoners to voluntarily renounce their
obduracy and succumb to such mild treatment and the
accumulation of cases where the prisoner stood mute
and the growing popularity of this offense, seemed to
threaten the speedy dispatch of the criminal business
of the period. Starvation was then added to the punishment
of confinement, but this did not accomplish the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
desired end, of forcing these obdurate offenders to
consent to be tried, according to the custom then obtaining.</p>

<p>As before seen, the first statute, touching upon this
punishment, passed during the reign of Edward I., applied
only to “notorious felons,” who were “openly
of evil name,” for these alone, refusing to plead before
the justices at the King’s suit, were to have the “strong
and hard punishment,” that the act called for, and
by express statutory exception prisoners “taken upon
light suspicion” were not to suffer the punishment.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Some writers have taken the position that the punishment,
<i>peine forte et dure</i> owed its existence alone to
this statute, but Sir Edward Coke states that the
punishment was assessed at common law, before the
enactment of this statute,<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and the statute in merely
providing for an imprisonment <i>forte et dure</i>, was declaratory
of an existing punishment assessed by the
common law, but not sufficiently described, or limited.</p>

<p>This view is shared by Reeves, who states that this
method of treating felons who stood mute was introduced
sometime between the fifth year of the reign of
King Henry III. or perhaps from the time of Bracton,
and the third year of King Edward I. and the punishment
did not owe its existence to this statute.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>However this may be, we find that during the reign
of Henry IV. the mild punishment provided for by the
statute of Edward I. and the proceedings detailed by
Fleta and Britton,<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> of merely being fastened down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
with irons, on the bare ground of the prison, “until
the plea was entered,” had given way to the harsher
punishment of being compelled to lie under a “<i>peine</i>,”
“<i>till they were dead</i>,” an event most likely to follow
speedily from the quantity of weight or iron placed
upon such prisoners. The <i>peine forte et dure</i>, as it
was known, therefore, from the fifteenth to the eighteenth
century, seems to have been firmly established as
an institution of the English Criminal Law, during the
time of Henry IV., and the reason for its existence
is to be found in the object of the justices in eyre and
justices of gaol delivery, of obviating the necessity of
remaining for long periods in the English country
towns, waiting for the mild effect of the formerly prevailing
punishment, provided for by the statute of the
reign of Edward I., in inducing prisoners charged with
felony to consent to be tried.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The prevalency of the practice of standing mute in
such cases, under the milder form of punishment, increased
to such an extent that the patience of the justices
was sorely tried. They determined, about the beginning
of the fifteenth century, to put an end to such
a practice, by furnishing such a harsh punishment that
the example of inflicting it would discourage prisoners
from thus defying the law, even if it resulted in the
speedy and painful death of the offender. All exhortations
and mild treatment were abandoned and the
obdurate prisoner, thus defying the court, was sentenced
to be literally “pressed to death,” unless he
recanted and submitted himself to a trial, according
to the fixed customs of the realm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>It may justly be doubted if the defiance of the majesty
of the law by this failure to plead was sufficient to
justify such a barbarous practice, with the object of
compelling a respect for the law, or if the remedy was
not really worse than the disease, but upon this philosophical
phase of the subject we are not concerned.
Whether justly or unjustly, this species of punishment
obtained for three centuries and a half in the English
criminal law and a great many concrete cases, illustrating
the application of the custom, arose during this
period. And it is interesting to note how the punishment
was made more severe with the increasing prevalency
of the offense.</p>

<p>In the year 1219, when the first eyre of Henry III.’s
reign was in session, a case arose for the instruction
and advice of the King’s Council regarding the course
to be pursued where the prisoner refused to plead.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>It was decided that although the prisoner was
charged with the gravest kind of a felony, he was to
be safely kept in prison, but the imprisonment was not
to endanger life or limb. No suggestion was made of
attempting to compel the submission to a trial, and the
details of assessing the punishment to be inflicted was
left wholly to the discretion of the justices.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The cases occurring before the passage of the statute
of Westminster in the reign of Edward I., show that
the justices did not have any fixed method of handling
the cases wherein the prisoner refused to plead, but
took such course as seemed best suited to the individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
case before the court. Sometimes the expedient was
resorted to of taking the verdict of an exceptionally
strong jury and condemning the prisoner, if he was
found guilty, regardless of whether he had formally
entered his plea or not. During the Warwickshire eyre
of 1221 Martin Pateshull pursued this course, on two
different occasions.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The prisoner stood mute and refused
to plead, but the twelve hundredors and twenty-four
other knights, having sworn to his guilt, he was
hanged.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>In 1222, on the refusal of a prisoner accused of receiving
felons, to plead to the charge, at Westminster,
the court merely committed him to prison, to be held
in solitary confinement, although the townships and
the knights of the shire had declared him guilty.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>During Bracton’s time, the procedure does not seem
to have taken the course that it did in later years, as
he speaks of the method of compelling a man to place
himself upon the country and states that he was considered
undefended and quasi-convict, if he refused.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Thus, it appears that before the enactment of the
statute of Edward I. the cases arising were determined
without any fixed rule governing the punishment to
be assessed, but a few years after this act, the prisoner
was laden with irons and in the course of a short
period the hideous <i>peine forte et dure</i> was developed.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Edward III. the courts adopted
starvation as a remedy for refusing to plead to an indictment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
for murder, as the case of Cecelia Rygeway
illustrates. She was indicted for the murder of her
husband and refusing to plead, she obstinately stood
mute. She was committed to prison and lived without
meat or drink for a period of forty days and nights,
when she was allowed to go free, as her wonderful
longevity, without food, was ascribed to the influence
of the Virgin Mary, whose intercession could only be
reconciled with the innocence of the defendant.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Starvation was generally discarded sometime after
the statute of Edward I. and after the reign of Henry
IV. the <i>peine forte et dure</i> was the regular and lawful
mode of punishing persons who stood mute and obstinately
refused to plead in charges of felony.</p>

<p>In 1442 Juliana Quick was arraigned upon a charge
of high treason, for speaking contemptuously of the
King, Henry VI. She refused to plead and it having
been determined that her refusal was obstinate, rather
than by an infirmity of nature, she was “pressed to
death,” in a summary manner.</p>

<p>The case of Margaret Clitherow, who was pressed
to death at York, on Lady Day, March 25’, 1586, is
most pathetic, as narrated by her spiritual adviser,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
the good John Mush, a friendly priest. Margaret’s
husband was a Protestant, but she was accused of
harboring Jesuit and Seminary priests, of hearing mass
and other similar offenses and so she was committed
to York Castle and later was regularly arraigned in the
Common Hall. When plied with the usual question,
“Culprit, how will you be tried?” instead of making
the usual answer, “By God and my country,” the prisoner
refused to make any other answer than that she
would be tried “by God and your consciences.” After
repeated entreaties by the court, and continued obstinacy
of the prisoner, she was committed to prison and
during the intercession of the court Parson Whigington,
a puritan preacher, labored long and hard with her
to convince her that she ought to forego her obduracy
and enter her plea, but she refused to do so. On her
second arraignment, when the court seemed about to
condemn her to the <i>peine forte et dure</i>, Parson Whigington
spoke in the interest of the prisoner, calling the
court’s attention to the fact that “this woman’s case
is touching life and death; you ought not, either by
God’s law, or man’s, to judge her to die upon the
slender witness of a boy.” Entreating her twice again
to renounce her obdurate plea and to throw her case
upon the country, on her refusal, the court ordered “the
law to take its course”; she had her arms pinioned
with a cord, by the Sheriff and as she was led through
the crowd, the jeers and taunts, ever levelled at the
unfortunate, in keeping with “man’s inhumanity to
man,” gave the Sheriff the idea that he was to soon
become a popular man, by the murder of this defenseless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
woman, so he proceeded to his work as if he were,
in fact, a hero.</p>

<p>She was urged to press the exemption of pregnancy,
but refused, and the Lord Mayor of York, on his knees
begged her to enter her formal plea to the charge
against her and to submit to trial, as did her friend
the good Parson Whigington. She stood firm, as if
courting martyrdom, in an attempt to demonstrate
the injustice of such a hideous punishment, and finally
even the sympathetic Parson Whigington, after expressing
his pity, left her and came again no more.</p>

<p>Her execution having been set for Friday, as if in
commemoration of the day when the gentle Saviour took
his departure upon the cross of Calvary, this innocent
woman, on Lady Day, in 1586, also suffered martyrdom
and died her death, that the horrible example of this
hideous punishment could be made the more detestable.
She refused the offer of friends to add sufficient weight
to dispatch her immediately, but subjected herself to
the torture, as deliberately as any martyr ever took
the rack. She was led bare legged and bare-footed
through the street, with a loose gown to hide her nakedness
and distributed alms to the idle spectators as
she passed along. The inhuman wretch who acted as
Sheriff was named Fawcett and with no instinct of
decency or chivalry, he bade her “put off her apparel,”
whereupon she pleaded on her knees, that she might
be allowed to die in her “smock” and that “for the
honor of womankind, they would not see her naked.”
Fawcett refused this becoming plea, but finally, on
the entreaty of her friends, she was allowed to die
in a long loose linen robe she had made for the occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>She was placed flat upon the ground on her back,
with a handkerchief on her face; a door was laid upon
her body and her hands were bound by Fawcett to two
posts, so that her arms and body made a perfect cross;
even as the Holy One of Galilee was taunted by the mob
who followed Him to Calvary, so this innocent soul
was crossed by the taunts and gibes of the vulgar mob,
until finally the weights were placed upon the door.
A large, sharp stone had been placed under her back,
and seven or eight hundred pound weight was placed
on the door and this weight broke her ribs and caused
them to burst through the flesh on her sides. She gave
but a single cry and exclaimed: “Jesu, Jesu, Jesu,
have mercy upon me.”<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Let us hope that with the wail
of this lost soul the weeping Christ made room for
the misguided martyr, in a realm where such Satanic
tyranny and intolerable cruelty are unknown. Strange,
is it not, that the death knell of this hideous and cruel
procedure did not follow immediately, as a result of
the aroused and outraged public feeling, after the
death of this good woman, in this cruel manner? But
when it is considered that such Satanic cruelty could
have lasted for sixteen hundred years after the crucifixion
of the Saviour—and that all traces of his presence
are not entirely eliminated from the earth, as yet—it
is quite evident that the ideals of holiness and righteousness
are slow to permeate the hearts of all the
human family.</p>

<p>Anthony Arrowsmith stood mute and refused to
plead to the charge of felony, in 1598, and was accordingly
pressed to death, in the usual manner.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>Walter Calverly, of Calverly in Yorkshire, was arraigned
at the York assizes in 1605, for murdering his
two children and stabbing his wife, and on refusing to
enter his plea he was pressed to death, in the castle, by
a large iron weight, placed on his breast.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>It would be impossible, in any reasonable space, to
recount all the most interesting cases where this inhuman
punishment was inflicted, during the last half
of the sixteenth and the early part of the seventeenth
centuries, as a great many prisoners underwent this
torture about this time. For the nine years between
1609 and 1618, for instance, there were thirty-two prisoners
subjected to this punishment and among this
number three were women, in Middlesex county alone.
In the record of these cases the Clerk wrote the words:
“<i>Mortuus en pen fort et dur</i>,” which furnished the sad
epitaph for each of the beknighted sufferers who underwent
this fearful punishment. The records show that
many of these poor prisoners were totally destitute
and suffered this punishment either through stupidity
of the prisoner or of his counsel, or through obstinacy
or indifference to his personal suffering and death.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In 1615 Sir Richard Weston, a prisoner of some note,
was arraigned for the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury.
He stood mute and obstinately refused to plead to the
indictment, after being solemnly warned by the judges
of the terrible consequences of his persisting in his
defiance of the laws of his country. The proceedings
were adjourned to give him time for reflection, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
on his continued obstinacy, he was adjudged to suffer
the <i>peine forte et dure</i>.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Major Strangeways was pressed to death, at Newgate,
in 1657, for obstinately refusing to plead to an
indictment charging him with the murder of his brother-in-law,
Mr. Fussell. At the Coroner’s inquest he was
made to take the corpse by the hands and touch the
wounds, upon the supposition that if he had committed
the murder, the wounds would bleed afresh. Although
he was innocent, according to this test, it availed him
nothing, however, and he was placed upon trial at the
Old Bailey, where so many tragedies were enacted, in
the olden time, in the name of the law, and refusing
to plead and standing mute, in order to prevent the
attainder of his blood and the forfeiture of his estate,
resulting from his conviction, so certain to follow his
trial, he was condemned to the <i>peine forte et dure</i>.
The press was placed upon him angle-wise and although
of sufficient weight to cause him much pain, it was
not heavy enough to kill him, so the spectators, through
pity, no doubt, for the sufferer, added the weight of
their bodies to that of the press and soon he was out
of his suffering and in keeping with the custom of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
the period his dead body was displayed to the vulgar
gaze,<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> that the morbidly curious could advertise the
details of the tragedy and thus deter other offenders
from a similar offense.</p>

<p>In the year 1720, a man named Phillips, who stood
mute and refused to plead to an indictment for felony,
was adjudged to undergo the <i>peine forte et dure</i>; he was
placed under the press at Newgate and suffered the
torture for a considerable time, until he concluded to
enter his plea of not guilty and stand trial, in the ordinary
manner, so the press was removed and he entered
his plea and stood trial.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>And in the following year, one Nathaniel Hawes,
upon his arraignment for a felony, stood mute and
obstinately refused to enter his plea and on being
sentenced to the <i>peine forte et dure</i>, he suffered the
pressure of a weight of two hundred and fifty pounds
for a period of seven minutes and then gave up his
resolution and craved the privilege of entering his
plea and throwing himself upon the country in his
trial.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>In 1726 a man named Burnworth, arraigned for
murder, concluded that he would stand mute and try
the effects of the <i>peine forte et dure</i>. He was sentenced
at Kingston to suffer this punishment for his obstinate
defiance of his country’s laws and after being pressed
for an hour and three-quarters, with four hundred
pounds of iron, his will was broken. He was taken to
the dock and was tried, convicted and hanged.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>From the number of reported cases that have been
inspected, it seems that a great many were unable to
withstand the suffering resulting from the application
of the weight to their bodies, but when the torture
was experienced, they would weaken and conclude to
enter their plea.</p>

<p>This was true of John Durant, who was arraigned
at the Old Bailey, in 1734. Upon his obstinately refusing
to enter his plea upon a charge of felony, his thumbs
were first tied together with whipcord and the Sheriff
pulled him up taut in the presence of the court and
the latter dignitary promised him the <i>peine forte et
dure</i>, forthwith, if he did not regularly enter his plea
to the indictment. On reflection, he concluded to do
this, so he was placed upon his trial and filed his plea
of not guilty.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>As late as the year 1741, it is reported that a prisoner
was pressed to death, at the Cambridge assizes,
for standing mute and refusing to plead to a charge of
felony, after the tying of his thumbs and other customary
procedure was found to be unavailing.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The only instance noted in which this punishment
was ever inflicted in the United States, was in the case
of Giles Cory, of Salem, who stood mute and obstinately
refused to plead, when arraigned upon a charge
of witchcraft and sorcery.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>He was arraigned at Salem, in April, 1692, before
Hawthorn and Jonathan Curwin. “Mary Walcott,
Mercy Lewis, Ann Putnam, Jr., and Abigail Williams
affirmed he had hurt them.” He was accused of giving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
Elizabeth Hubbard a fit; of hurting Benjamin Gold;
of bringing the book to these various witnesses; of
being frightened in the cowhouse and of threatening
suicide.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>On September 16’ “just as the Autumn leaves were
beginning to glorify the earth,” he was laid upon the
ground, bound hand and foot; stones were piled upon
him, till the tongue was pressed out of his mouth.
The Sheriff with his cane, forced it in again, when he
was dying.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> And he was the first and last to die for
this offense in New England.</p>

<p>In his account of this trial, in the “New England
Tragedies,” the gentle Longfellow, has made Cory
thus explain to Richard Gardner, why he refused to
plead:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I will not plead.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If I deny, I am condemned already,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In Courts where ghosts appear as witnesses,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And swear men’s lives away—If I confess,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then I confess a lie, to buy a life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which is not life, but only death in life.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will not bear false witness against any,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor even against myself, whom I count least.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Sheriff then calls him to his punishment and
Cory answers him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I come.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here is my body. Ye may torture it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the immortal soul, ye cannot crush.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Gloyd wonders if</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The old man will die and will not plead,”</div>
  </div>

<p class="noindent">and while thus wondering, arrives too late to view the
test of martyrdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>In Scene IV. of this tragedy, based upon this sad
miscarriage of justice in this New England case, the
field near the graveyard is presented, with Cory lying
dead, with a great stone upon his breast.</p>

<p>Hathorn and Mather are introduced to the spectators
and make a vain attempt to explain and justify
the deed and the former points to the dead body of
Cory as a horrible example of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Those who deal in witchcraft and when questioned,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But Mather, not satisfied with the proceeding, is
thus made to deliver himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“In a land like this,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Those who lie buried in the Potter’s field,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will rise again, as surely as ourselves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That sleep in honored graves, with epitaphs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And this poor man, whom we have made a victim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hereafter will be counted as a martyr.”<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The <i>peine forte et dure</i>, as an institution of the
English courts, continued in effect, as a part of the
criminal procedure of the kingdom, until the year 1772,
when the statute 12 George III., c. 20, virtually abolished
the punishment of pressing prisoners to death
for standing mute, when called upon to plead.</p>

<p>This statute declared that any person who should
stand mute and refuse to plead, when arraigned for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
felony or piracy, should be convicted, and suffer judgment
and sentence to be rendered against him, the same
as if he had been regularly convicted, by verdict or
confession.</p>

<p>This procedure was again changed in England, in
the year 1827 by the more humane rule, that upon a
failure or refusal of the defendant in a felony charge
to plead to the indictment, “a plea of not guilty should
be entered for the person accused,”<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and he was thus
given the benefit of the legal presumption of innocence,
which the criminal law surrounds all prisoners with
and he could be convicted and sentenced for the offense
charged in the indictment only after this presumption
of innocence had been overcome by the proof of his
guilt, even though he stood mute and refused to enter
his formal plea.</p>

<p>This latter statute, in substance, has been adopted
in most of the United States and the cases arising
under these statutes illustrate the beneficence of the
new procedure.</p>

<p>In Commonwealth vs. Braley,<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> in the year 1804, the
defendant stood mute and refused to plead and the
court proceeded to empanel a jury to try the defendant
to ascertain if he stood mute wilfully, or by Act
of God, just as the court proceeded when the <i>peine forte
et dure</i> was in force and on the return of the verdict
that the defendant wilfully refused to plead, the court
remanded him to jail.</p>

<p>In Commonwealth vs. Moore,<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> in the year 1812, the
defendant was arraigned upon a charge of larceny and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
stood mute and upon a finding of the jury that he stood
mute through wilfullness, the court proceeded to sentence
him, just as if he had been regularly convicted,
evidently proceeding under the statute, 12 George III.,
c. 20.</p>

<p>In State vs. Hare, in the year 1818, in Maryland, the
prisoner stood mute and refused to plead, but the court
entered up a plea of not guilty for him and proceeded
to try him, just as if he had himself entered his formal
plea. This enlightened procedure was adopted by
Congress at the beginning of the past century, in all
cases where prisoners stood mute.</p>

<p>It was provided by Act of Congress, March 3’, 1825,
that</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If any person, upon his or her arraignment, upon
any indictment, before any court of the United States,
for any offense not capital, shall stand mute or will
not answer or plead to such indictment, the court shall
notwithstanding, proceed to the trial of the person
so standing mute, or refusing to answer or plead, as
if he or she had pleaded not guilty, and, upon a verdict
being returned by the jury, may proceed to render
judgment accordingly.”<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Since the enactment of this federal statute, similar
acts have been adopted in most of the United States
and the practice now quite generally obtains of entering
a formal plea of not guilty, whenever the prisoner
stands mute, for any reason and the trial proceeds
just as if the defendant had himself entered his plea.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>The punishment for standing mute and refusing to
plead, as one of the cruel and extreme methods of procedure
of the olden times, has attracted the attention
of the poets and writers in the English language.</p>

<p>Shakespeare makes frequent reference to this punishment
and always in such manner as to demonstrate
that he was thoroughly familiar with the nature and
object of the procedure governing the infliction of the
penalty upon those who obstinately stood mute, when
called upon to plead to indictments for felonies.</p>

<p>Thus, in “Much Ado About Nothing” he makes
Hero say to Ursula, when speaking of Beatrice, in the
Orchard of Leonato:<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Hero.</i> No, not to be so odd and from all fashions</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Out of myself, press me to death with wit.”<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In “Measure for Measure,” when the Duke adjudged
that Lucio should marry the woman he had wronged,
the latter replied:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Lucio.</i> Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, whipping
and hanging.”<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>In Richard II., on overhearing the talk of the Gardener
and servant, in the Duke of York’s garden, concerning
the King, the Queen soliloquizes</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Queen.</i> O, I am pressed to death through want of speaking,”<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">as if she were really in the dock and actually conditioned
so that she would suffer the customary penalty
for standing mute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p>Pandarus also refers to the <i>peine forte et dure</i>, in
Troilus and Cressida, in advising them to “press” the
bed to death because it stands mute as to their “pretty
encounters” thereon:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Pan.</i> ... I will show you a chamber and a bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which bed, because it shall not speak of your pretty encounters,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Press it to death: away.”<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>By a study of the old cases, decided when the <i>peine
forte et dure</i> obtained, the development of the law on
this subject, can best be understood, for like landmarks,
pointing the devious course of the tortuous procedure
that obtained for centuries, before the evolution of the
science, to the point where it was able to preserve the
just rights of the individual, consistently with the demands
of society, the later cases evidence the gradual
decline of the old, harsh punishment for standing mute,
and thus, with the abolition of this quandam formal
procedure, that was considered such a material part
of the old criminal law of England, the law itself has
reached a higher plane, from which we can look down
upon the crudities and cruelties of the old system,
with pity for the multitudes who were subjected to its
harsh rules and false standards. And judging the
future by the past, we can indulge the hope that many
of our own formal procedures will be amended and abolished,
to the end that unjust results and delays may be
minimized and the attainment of just ideals promoted.</p>

<p>The science of the law should keep pace with the
advance of the student of philosophy. The law should
ever stand aloof—even as a just parent—from any
punishment prompted solely through the mad power of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
might. When it has attempted to inflict punishment
unjustly, the causes and effects, the advantages, if
any and the disadvantage of such procedure, should
be thoroughly scrutinized. Laws are man-made, in
popular governments and the laws should be improved
for the benefit of the people.</p>

<p>We have seen that for centuries, upon the obstinate
refusal of a prisoner charged with felony, to enter his
plea, the inhuman judgments of the courts—established
for the administration of justice—were that he should
be literally “pressed to death,” regardless of his guilt
or innocence of the charge that he was called upon to
answer.</p>

<p>With the passing of this horrible institution—as
with others of the past centuries—we can perhaps congratulate
ourselves, that with the evolution of the institutions
of our civilization, humanity has generally
triumphed over inhumanity and the mistakes of our
ancestors, although most dearly bought, furnish a lasting
object lesson for present and future generations.
Every generation, however, has its follies and mistakes
and nonsense is not confined wholly to the past ages, but
with the errors of the past before us, we ought to avoid
the same mistakes that it took such suffering and
experience to correct.</p>

<p>However unwise and unjust the standards of our
ancestors may have been, which made possible the
wholesale legal murder of thousands of human beings,
who, for different reasons, defied the fetish and barbarous
custom that developed the cruel institution,
<i>peine forte et dure</i>, this institution, like many others of
the past, ought to warn us, like a beacon light, of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
dangerous shoals and reefs, which the ship of state
should be safely piloted around. But our own procedure
contains many incongruities and erroneous standards,
that should be corrected, and while priding ourselves
upon the fact that nothing so inhuman as “pressing
to death,” obtains today, we are still guilty of many
“crimes against criminals,” which succeeding ages, in
the perfection of the science of jurisprudence, will no
doubt regard in much the same light as we of the present

<p>During the reign of Henry VII., we find two felons, who had
been taken from sanctuary, at Southwark, on being arraigned before
Sir Thomas Frowike urged their plea of sanctuary, which was
overruled, and, on being commanded to plead to the felonies, and
refusing, they were peremptorily ordered to be taken back to the
jail and there placed upon the bare ground, and that more weight
should be placed upon them than they could stand and they be
given only bread and water, until they die; in short, that they
be literally <i>pressed to death</i>, or suffer the terrible <i>peine forte et
dure</i>. (21 Henry VII., Keilway, 70; IV. Reeve’s History English
Law, Finlason’s note, p. 254.)</p>

<p>According to Rushworth, when John Felton was arraigned for
the assassination of the Duke of Buckingham, in November, 1628,
the Privy Council debated the question of their right to place the
prisoner on the rack. It was finally decided that:</p>

<p>“Torture was not, with one exception, permitted at all, and in
that one exception, it was permitted neither as a punishment nor
as a means of getting evidence, but as a <i>persuasion</i>, to induce a
man charged with felony, to put himself upon his trial.”</p>

<span class="smcap">Wager of Law.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Wager of law, in ancient England, was the practice
whereby the defendant was allowed to make oath denying
the charge of the complainant and supporting
his oath by the oaths of a certain number of his friends
or neighbors.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The term <i>wager of law</i>, comes from the Roman law
<i>vadiatio legis</i>, from the defendant being put in pledges
(<i>vadios</i>), to make oath on the day appointed.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The practice is traceable to the Mosaic law which
provided that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If a man deliver unto his neighbor an ass, or an
ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be
hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it; then shall an
oath of the Lord be between them both, that he hath
not put his hands unto his neighbors’ goods; and the
owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make
it good.”<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Under the Mosaic law, the rule of practice which
now obtains in criminal cases, that the good character
or reputation of the defendant is always proper for him
to offer, in his own defense, upon the issue of the likelihood
of his commission of a crime, was extended to
include his right to actually acquit himself of the debt
or other cause of action by his own oath, for if he would
absolutely swear himself not chargeable and was a
person of good reputation, he stood acquitted of the
charge, in order to prevent an innocent man from being
overcome by a multitude of false witnesses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>This method of procedure, or similar practices obtained
in ancient Babylon,<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> among the Romans and the
northern nations, adjacent to the Roman Empire, as
well as among the ancient Israelites.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>He who waged his law, under the old Saxon procedure,
brought with him, into court, eleven of his
neighbors, for by the constitution entered into as a
league between Alfred and Guthrun, the Dane, a man’s
credit, in a court of law, depended upon his reputation
among his neighbors, touching his veracity.</p>

<p>The defendant who pleaded <i>nil debit</i>, or denied the
charge against him, usually concluded his answer with
the plea containing the formula:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And this he is ready to defend against him, the said
A. B. and his suit, as the court of our Lord, the King,
shall here consider,” <i>etc.</i></p>

</div>

<p>He was then placed under surety to <i>wage his law</i>, on
a day appointed by the judge and on the day named
the defendant, in open court, took his oath, which was
also confirmed by the oaths of eleven of his neighbors,
called compurgators.</p>

<p>The defendant stood at the end of the bar and was
solemnly admonished by the judge of the nature and
danger of a false oath and if he persisted, he repeated
an oath like the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hear this, ye justices, that I do not owe unto A. B.
the sum of ten pounds, nor any penny thereof, in manner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
and form as the said A. B. hath declared against
me, so help me God.”<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And thereupon his eleven compurgators avowed,
upon their oaths, that they believed, in their consciences,
that he saith the truth.</p>

<p>The oath, therefore, of the defendant, himself, was
<i>de fidelitate</i>, or on his fidelity, and the eleven compurgators
testified <i>de credulitate</i> or upon their belief in his
integrity.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>These oaths had the legal effect of a verdict for the
defendant, in all actions of debt, on a simple contract,
or in actions of detinue, but the defense was not allowed
to persons who did not enjoy a good reputation among
their neighbors.</p>

<p>The compurgators acted rather in the capacity of
jurymen than as witnesses, for they swore to their
belief, not to what they actually knew. In other words,
when the accused made oath of his innocence or denied
the charge filed against him, they swore that they believed
he was swearing the truth. Yet they differed
from jurymen in many important particulars. The jury
was summoned by a public officer and took an oath to
tell the truth, whatever the truth might be—for jurymen
then did not sit in trial of issues as today—while
the oath helper—or compurgator, merely took an oath
to testify to the truth of his principal’s oath.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>There is authority for the proposition that in the
earliest times, the oath-helpers were necessarily kinsmen
of the defendant.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The only obligation recognized
by a defendant in either a civil or criminal case was to
the injured party and no responsibility was predicated
upon a duty owing to the state or to society at large.
With the family as a unit, the person charged with a
crime could summon his family to repulse an armed
attack by the injured person and so he took them with
him to the court, to defend him by their oaths.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> When
a person was accused of a crime sufficient to result in
a blood-feud, his kinsmen were vitally interested in
his acquittal and it is but natural that they proffered
their help as oath-helpers for him, but in due course of
time, the relatives alone were not required and the
compurgators rather assumed the character of disinterested
“character witnesses,” such as we see today,
in all criminal cases, except that instead of swearing
merely to the good reputation of the defendant, these
compurgators made oath of their firm belief in his oath
of innocence of the charge filed against him or of the
cause of action set up by the injured party.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>By the laws of Wihtraed,<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> in the seventh century,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
the king or a bishop could rebut an accusation
by his own simple asservation, and the thane or
priest by the simple oath, while the laity generally
were required to undergo the formal procedure of
waging their law by the regular number of compurgators.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeves, in his History of English Law, says
that Glanville does not mention the wager of law, as
a mode of proof for the defendant in civil suits,<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> but
in this the author must have meant to limit the statement
to defenses only, for Glanville expressly describes
the proceeding by the tenant, wherein he observes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If he should deny all the summonses, he shall, as
to each of them individually, corroborate his denial
with the oaths of twelve. Should it happen on the day
appointed that either of the compurgators fail, or
should the person of either of them be justly excepted
to, and the vacancy occasioned by either of these circumstances
not filled up, the tenant shall, on account
of his default, immediately lose his seisin. But, if the
tenant thus completely disprove the summonses, he
shall, on the same day, answer to the action.”<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

</div>

<p>According to Sir Edward Coke, any one who waged
his law, in a court of record, prior to <i>Magna Charta</i>, in
England, was required to bring with him <i>Fideles
Testes</i>,<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and this learned author intimates that the
number of compurgators was eleven, besides the principal,<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
while the author of “<i>Les Termes de la Ley</i>,”
in describing the same ceremony, expressly states that
the number of compurgators was twelve.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>Bracton advises us that it was not necessary that the
compurgators should be of the same rank as the principal,
provided they were trustworthy citizens,<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and,
when treating of the wager of law, in actions by tenants,
he states that the land was not to be taken out of the
tenant’s possession before the tenant had waged his
law, nor if he failed in waging it.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> And he states that
the tenant could not wage his law by means of an attorney,
constituted for that purpose, but was allowed
to urge this plea, only by and through himself, personally.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>In Bracton’s day, wager of law was the normal
mode of defense and it was then the ordinary procedure
for establishing that one had never been lawfully
summoned to appear in court;<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> that a defendant had
not deprived a guardian of the lawful possession of
his ward;<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> that the defendant was not guilty of a
breach of a covenant;<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> that the defendant had not
wrongfully detained or distrained the plaintiff’s cattle
or other animals,<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and during this period it was even
allowed by way of defense in an action of trespass.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>According to Bracton, however, compurgation was
not allowed to dispute evidence of offenses which were
apparent to the senses, such as waste, which could be
observed, as a physical condition, by any man, for if
compurgation were allowed in such cases, the oath of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
compurgators would be allowed to overcome the evidence
of our senses, which would place a premium on
perjury and destroy the best evidence by mere secondary
proof.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The wager of law was not confined entirely to the
defendant, however, for according to this author, if
the defendant set up an affirmative defense, the plaintiff,
by way of reply, was allowed to deny the affirmative
defense and to establish his avoidance of the special
defense pleaded by the aid of oath-helpers.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Edward III., the right of a defendant
to wage his law, was guaranteed in all cases
where the right existed in the time of Edward I., the
object of the statute being that “many people were
grieved and attached by their bodies in the city of
London, at the suit of citizens, surmising that they
were debtors, and could be proved so by their papers,
though they had no deed or tally to produce them,”
it was therefore enacted that “every man should be
received <i>to his law</i>, by people of his condition against
such papers, and the creditor should not put the party
to plead to the inquest unless he chose,”<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> so the wager
of law was thus preserved to the citizens of London,
against mere papers, or verbal testimony as firmly as
it was previously practiced in the common law courts.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
But it was provided by statute, during the same reign,
that the fines payable before the justices, should be in
the presence of the pledges, in all cases, civil or criminal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
and the pledges were to be advised of the sum of
the fine, before they departed.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The law wager did not seem to be settled so securely
that there was no doubt left, of the cases in
which it would lie and those wherein it could not be
invoked, in this reign, however, for while a defendant
was denied wager of law, against his written obligation,<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
he was allowed to wage his law, in a suit on a
deed, by the plea of non-summons, in the same manner
that such plea had long been used.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> It was allowed
against a receipt, alleged to be by the hand of another
than the defendant,<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and in detinue of charters it was
allowed,<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> although the charters related to the freehold
and ought to be equally as binding upon a defendant
as an obligation creating an action of debt.</p>

<p>Wager of law was allowed in all cases where voluntary
credit had been extended to the defendant, upon
the theory that by giving him credit the plaintiff had
estopped himself from denying that he was a man of
good reputation, but wager of law was not permitted in
charges created against the defendant by the law, for
no man was allowed to thus swear away an obligation
imposed by the law of the land.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>It was denied in cases of contempt, trespass, fraud
or deceit, or for damages for any injury with force;
executors and administrators were not allowed, upon
grounds of public policy, to deny under oath the obligations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
of their testators, since no man could safely
wage law of another’s contracts; the king had certain
prerogatives, which prevented the wager of law, in
actions by him, as all wagers of law naturally reflected
upon the honesty of the plaintiff, so wager did not obtain
in actions by the king.<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>And since the wager of law only obtained in favor
of those who bore a good reputation for veracity, one
who had been outlawed, or attainted for any felony,
or one who had become infamous, or who had pronounced
the horrible word, <i>craven</i>, in a trial by battle,
was denied his wager of law.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>And under the old practice, since infants, or those
under twenty-one years were not admitted to take
oaths, they were also denied the wager of law, but a
married woman was allowed the defense, when sued
jointly with her husband and it extended in favor of
an alien, who was to be sworn in his own language.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries compurgators
were allowed, even in the most serious charges
of felony, in England, on the part of a defendant. According
to the London custom, in the “great law” used
in murder cases, the defendant was required to swear
six times, with six compurgators for each oath; in the
“middle law,” used in charges of mayhem, three oaths,
each backed by six oath-helpers, satisfied the law, and
in “the third law,” used in the smaller offenses, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
single oath, corroborated by six helpers, satisfied the
law.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>In course of time the “great law” was found to be
so onerous that the rule requiring six separate compurgators
to as many separate oaths by the defendant
was relaxed, so as to allow him to make his compurgation
by one oath, supported by thirty-six helpers, but
if any one of these failed to support his oath, he was
hanged.<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>And by the last of the fourteenth century even when
charged with the capital crime of murder, a citizen
liable under the “great law,” which formerly required
him to make his compurgation by thirty-six oath-helpers,
was allowed to either make his compurgation
in this manner, or, at his election, to go to trial before
a jury of twelve men, for by this period the trial by
jury was beginning to take its place as one of the fixed
institutions in the administration of the criminal law
of England.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The trial by oath-helpers, even in murder cases, was
not speedily superceded by the trial by jury, however,
for as late as the fifteenth century, according to Palgrave,
purgation with thirty-six oath-helpers, was allowed
at Winchelsea and in other jurisdictions subject
to the English common law.<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span></p>

<p>By the time of Henry VI., we find the cases in which
wager of law was allowed still open to much discussion.
It was recognized in actions of debt and detinue<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
and in the action of account, it came to be the
custom for the justices to examine the attorney for the
plaintiff and other persons and to allow or refuse the
wager of law to the defendant,<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> accordingly as the
account was found to be an account stated in the
presence of auditors, in which case it was not allowed,
or an account not taken in the presence of auditors,
where the wager was held to obtain.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The theory of
denying the wager to cases where an account was had
in the presence of auditors was that such an account
arose to the dignity of an obligation admitted before
competent judges.<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>A defendant sued upon a debt for board and lodging
was denied his law,<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> but Justices Priscott and
Needham, decided, near the end of the reign of Henry
VI. that wager of law would lie in an action for board
and lodging, if the plaintiff had it in his power to
furnish the board or lodging at his own volition and
not upon compulsion,<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> but if the defendant had been
imprisoned in the Tower and the board and lodging was
furnished by force of the obligation of common humanity,
this would so far deprive the plaintiff of his option
of furnishing the board and lodging, as to make him a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
creditor of such merit as to deprive the defendant of
his wager of law.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Where persons were compelled to serve by the statute
of laborers, such as plowmen, shepherds, and all
servants of husbandry, in an action for wages, the defendant
was not allowed his wager of law, because the
plaintiff had no option to refuse the service, but in
cases where the service was not compulsory, wager of
law would lie.<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>And upon the theory that an attorney could be compelled
by the judges of the common pleas court to
render faithful service to his client and was not allowed
to refuse such service, we find that Chief Justice
Fortescue decided, during this reign, that in an action
by an attorney for services rendered in such a court,
no wager of law would lie on the part of defendant.<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>By the middle of the fifteenth century, in England,
the wager of law in criminal cases had begun to fall
into disuse, for the method followed in such trials, at
Westminster, was such that professional oath-helpers
were customarily used and such professional swearers
necessarily debased the wager of law in criminal
cases.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> And in the courts of the country districts it
got to be a very easy matter for a citizen of bad repute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
to produce his oath-helpers, and his neighbors were
afraid to negative the oaths of men who were frequently
too desperate to thus antagonize,<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and this
led to a gradual preference for the trial by jury, in
criminal cases, both on the part of the person accused
of crime and by the general public, who came to regard
the wager of law, in such cases, with odium.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Long before its repeal, by statute, the old defense
had fallen into disuse, and in 1833, by 3 &amp; 4 William
IV.,<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> the wager of law was finally abolished in England,
and compurgation in the ecclesiastical courts
was abolished during the reign of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>While this irrational procedure obtained in England,
the accused in the gravest criminal charges, could avoid
punishment, regardless of the notorious character of
his crime, without being confronted with evidence of
his guilt, if he was able to find compurgators who
would testify to their belief in his innocence.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> And
while he could not invoke this procedure in a case of
theft, if the stolen goods were found upon his person,
or he had been previously convicted, in all other offenses,
he was at liberty to thus acquit himself, by
means of his oath-helpers,<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and this favorable procedure
for the criminals continued long after its abuses
were set forth and denounced in the Council of Bale,<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
in municipal and ecclesiastical courts, although in the
king’s court, in criminal cases of the graver sort compurgation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
is said to have disappeared in consequence
of what has been styled “the implied prohibition” of
the Assize of Clarendon, in 1166.<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> But the statute of
Elizabeth (38 Elizabeth, 3, 5), shows that the wager
was in common use in 1596, in actions of debt upon
simple contracts.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Turning to some of the instances where the oaths of
compurgators, or the wager of law, as known under the
old procedure, was utilized to acquit the accused of
charges, either in the ecclesiastical or lay courts of
old England, we find, in the sixth century, that Pope
Pelagius I., when confronted with charges that he
was concerned in the troubles which drove his predecessor
into exile, exculpated himself, by his oath,
taken in the pulpit, while holding the crucifix above
his head, denying any implication in the affairs that
had resulted in the disgrace of his predecessor.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>And when Gregory of Tours was arraigned for the
use of words which seriously reflected upon Fredegonda,
before a Council of Bishops, it was decided that
he should acquit himself of the charge by oaths upon
three separate altars, which in due time, the accused
performed to the complete satisfaction of the Council.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>In the dispute which arose, in 824, between Hubert,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
bishop of Worcester, and the abbot of Berkeley, in
regard to the monastery of Westbury, the issue was
settled by the oath of bishop Hubert, supported by
fifty priests, ten deacons and a hundred and fifty other
clerks and ecclesiastics.<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Again, the bishop of Trent, when accused of simony,
was ordered by Pope Innocent II. to clear himself with
the oaths of two bishops and three abbots or monks,
a course that was followed by the accused, to the complete
satisfaction of his superiors in the church.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Compurgation was, indeed, for many centuries the
common procedure whereby Churchmen, when accused
of simony, or other irregularities, cleared themselves
of the charges filed against them, and it seemed almost
invariably an easy task to find other brothers of the
order willing to stand by the accused and render him
the assistance of an oath in the belief of his innocence,
perhaps because of the frequency of such charges and
the uncertainty of the future and that necessity might
place the compurgators in a position where they might
desire the reciprocal service, rendered to their unfortunate
companion.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>In the thirteenth century the earl of Warenne, or
his men, slew Alan de la Zouche, in Westminster Hall,
in the presence of the king’s justices. He was allowed
to escape with his compurgators’ aid, according to the
rule then obtaining, by his own oath, supported by the
oaths of twenty-five knights, that the deed was not
done with malice aforethought, or in contempt of the
king, but under the heat of passion and under such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
circumstances as to reduce the offense to simple manslaughter.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>In the Bedfordshire eyre, of the year 1202, in a
prosecution under the statute for selling beer under a
false measure, the defendant when placed upon her
trial, claimed the right of compurgation and was
ordered to defend herself “twelve handed” and she
met the demand of the court by the offer of her compurgators.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>In April, 1435, Agnes Archer was indicted for the
alleged murder of Alice Colynbourgh, at Winchelsea,
whom she was charged with having stabbed five times
in the throat, with a knife. The defendant, when arraigned
for this crime entered a plea of not guilty, by
declaring, as the report of the case records it: “I am
not guilty of thoo dedys, ne noon of hem, God help me
so.” And when interrogated by the Judge as to how she
would acquit herself of this charge, she replied: “By
God and by my neighbors of this town,” so the charge
being one which brought the case within the rule of
the “Great Law,” she was required to acquit herself
by the oaths of thirty-six compurgators.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>In 1440, in a suit for board and lodging furnished
the defendant by the plaintiff, one Counselor, Yelverton,
for the plaintiff, contended that the defendant was
not entitled to his wager of law, in this action, but the
justices held that wager of law would lie in a suit for
board and lodging.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>During the reign of Henry VI., in the year 1454, quite
a memorable legal battle was waged concerning the
right of a defendant, in a real action, to wage his law
upon a plea of non-summons. The plaintiff demurred
to this plea and the justices were divided upon the
propriety of recognizing the plea. Chief Justice Priscot
and his associates, Danvers and Danby, overruled
the demurrer to this plea, holding that the defendant
could urge his wager of law in a real action, while admitting
that the practice had been otherwise. The
minority of the court, however, dissented from this
view, much as the minority frequently dissent in
modern times and Moile and Ayshton earnestly pressed
their views upon the majority of the court, for the
reason that, “All our law is directed by usage or statute;
it has been used that no one wages his law in
trespass, and the contrary in debt; so that we should
adjudge according to the use.”<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1492, one Sebastian Giglis complained
to the Chancellor against Robert Welby, that complainant
had persuaded a third party to advance a certain
sum of money to Welby, who promised to repay the
loan and then when he was sued therefor, by the creditor,
he had waged his law and the result was that
complainant had been compelled to pay the loan, so
advanced, at his instance, to Welby. In his answer to
this plea, Welby admitted the loan, but set up that he
had procured the money for King Richard III., who
had received and used the money and that the receipt
given was a mere memorandum of the transaction, but
not under seal, and he attempted to wage his law to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
this debt. The court refused to recognize the wager
of law in this case, but held that in as much as the plaintiff
had paid the debt for money had and received by
the defendant, and since the defendant admitted the
debt, and the receipt of the money, it was immaterial
that he had given it to another, and adjudged that he
should pay the plaintiff, and that no wager of law would
lie in such a case.<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1587 the Star Chamber refused to entertain
a criminal charge of perjury against a man who
was charged with having perjured himself in waging
his law, in a prior proceeding. The Lord Chancellor
rather dissented from the decision of the majority of
the judges and asked if the effect of the wager, based
on perjury was to discharge the debt sued for. The
judges answered that it was, Manwood, C. B., maintaining
that it was because of the plaintiff’s folly, in sueing
for debt, rather than upon an assumpsit, wherein
wager of law would not lie.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>In his report of Slade’s case, in 1602, Sir Edward
Coke remarked that the court would not allow a man
to wage his law, until the court had admonished both
the principal and the compurgators and upon due examination
as to their qualifications and the merits of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
the cause, in order to ascertain if the case was one
wherein wager of law was allowable.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Several cases came before Chief Justice Holt, during
the latter part of the seventeenth century and some of
the cases, which have been noted, will be briefly referred
to.</p>

<p>In the Company of Glazier’s Case, which arose in
1699, the Company sued in an action of debt and the
defendant waged his law. Counselor Northey appeared
for the Company and when the defendant appeared
with his compurgators, he insisted that if he swore falsely,
the court did not have to receive his wager of law, but
to this contention, Chief Justice Holt replied: “We can
admonish him, but if he will stand by his law, we cannot
hinder it, seeing it is a method the law allows.”
Plaintiff’s counsel then insisted that such a holding
would be a dangerous precedent, because it would have
the legal effect of compelling litigants sueing in debt,
to extend the practice of sueing upon an assumpsit
still further, but the doughty Chief Justice replied to
this argument that “We will carry them no further,”
so the wager of law was received, because it was a
“method the law allows.”<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The Chief Justice practically reversed his holding in
the Company of Glazier’s Case, two years later, however,
for in exactly the same kind of an action of debt,
arising on a by-law, in London vs. Wood, the court
refused to entertain the defendant’s plea of wager of
law, remarking that the plaintiff’s counsel in the Company
of Glazier’s Case (Northey), had yielded too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
much—although he seemed to do all that an earnest
counsel can do, to urge his plea and then except to the
court’s action, when it is overruled—in characterizing
that decision, the court observing that “It was a
gudgeon swallowed and so it passed without observation,”
meaning that a bad precedent had been recorded
because not strenuously enough objected to.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>In this case, the action was on a city by-law, for
the penalty provided for the refusal of the defendant
to serve as sheriff. According to the custom of London,
the defendant offered to wage his law, with six good
and reputable compurgators, but to this plea the plaintiff
demurred, and in considering the issue of law, on
the question of the right of the defendant to wage his
law, in such an action, Baron Hatsell reviewed the older
decisions bearing upon the defense of wager of law and
maintained that it would lie in five certain cases only,
“first, in debt on simple contract, which is the common
case; secondly, in debt upon an award, upon a parole
submission; thirdly, in an account against a receiver;
fourthly, in detinue, and fifthly, in an amercement in a
court baron, or other inferior court, not of record.”</p>

<p>Lord Holt repudiated the reasoning which limited
the Wager to any specific classes of actions, but maintained
that the wager could only be made to depend
upon other distinctions, growing out of the very nature
of the cause of action and not the mere class to which
it might belong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>In the course of his opinion in this celebrated case,
he observed:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This is the right difference, and not that which is
made in the actions, viz., that it lies in one sort of action
and not in another; but the true difference is when it
is grounded on the defendant’s wrong; ... for
if debt be brought, and the foundation of the action
is the wrong of the defendant, wager of law will not
lie.... The secrecy of the contract which raises
the debt is the reason of the wager of law; but if the
debt arises from a contract that is notorious, there
shall be no wager of law.”<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The great Chief Justice was far too independent to be
bound by the dictum of some previous case, which did
not commend itself to him, according to the touchstone
of reason or logic. He had a naturally inquiring
mind and sought to go deep into the mysteries of things.
Refused credence to the absurd or allegiance to an
arrogant authority and was too broad to be bound
by mere doctrine, but of course could only judge according
to the standards of his time.</p>

<p>This decision marks the trend of judicial thought of
the period to further limit and deny the wager of law,
because of the fact that it was becoming to be considered
contrary to the prevalent sense of right of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
great mass of citizenship, to permit one who was sufficiently
elastic in his conscience, to swear away the
debt or obligation of another, just as formerly it had
come to be regarded as wrong to permit the accused
in a criminal case, to set aside the public law which he
had violated, by means of the oaths of compurgators.</p>

<p>During the age of Bracton, the defendant, who was
incarcerated in jail and attempted to deny the obligation
for his board and lodging, by the wager of law,
was held incompetent to wage his law, in such a case,
because it was counter to reason to permit one to be
thus defeated of an obligation which he had recognized,
based upon feelings of common humanity.</p>

<p>In this opinion of Lord Hort, it was counter to his
idea of right, in the case of London vs. Wood,<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> to permit
the wager of law, to avoid an obligation which was
not merely secret, but notorious and where the recognition
of the right to wage law, would result in a
wrong upon the other party. The real reason for this
limitation of the right, however, was that the procedure
itself was wrong and the common sense of the nation
was becoming aware of the fact and thus the courts
for one reason or another, reached the conclusion that
this or that case was not one wherein the right could
be recognized, when, as a matter of fact, with the growing
popularity of the right of trial by jury, this old
procedure was eternally at war, since the former institution
was based upon the disinterested judgment of
impartial men, who were assembled to carefully weigh
the issues and pass judgment according to the right,
whereas, in the other procedure interested men, through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
the influence of friendship or other ties, were led to
approve the course of a neighbor or a friend, however
wrong his object might be, and assist him by the corroboration
of his oath.</p>

<p>A century after this leading case of London vs.
Wood,<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> however, in which Lord Holt and Baron Hatsell
differed as to the reasons why the right to wage his
law should be denied to the defendant in that case, the
right was recognized in England, although not expressly
enforced by the court. In 1805, the case of Barry vs.
Robinson,<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> came before the English Court of Common
Pleas and the Counsel for the plaintiff in his presentation
of his client’s cause before the court, said: “If a
man were now to tender his wager of law, the court
would refuse to allow it,” as the counsel considered
that this procedure was entirely obsolete at that period.
But the reporter of this case, however, advises us
that to this statement of counsel, the court demurred,
or, in the language of the Reporter, “This was denied
by the court.”</p>

<p>The last recorded case wherein this old defense was
attempted in England was in the year 1824, in the case
of King vs. Williams,<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> but as Professor Thayer observes,
in his “Older Modes of Trials,”<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> the wager
of law at this time was “a discredited stranger, ill
considered.” This was an action of debt, upon a simple
contract, a case wherein the wager of law clearly applied,
under the old practice. The defendant pleaded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
“<i>nil debet per legem</i>.” Counselor Langslow appeared
for the defendant and after filing this plea, asked the
court to assign the number of compurgators, for the
reason that “The books leave it doubtful and this
species of defense is not often heard of now.” This
requested rule, to assign the number of compurgators
to the defendant was refused by Abbot, C. J., who observed:
“The court will not give the defendant any
assistance in this matter. He must bring such number
of compurgators as he shall be advised are sufficient.”
This, upon the theory that everyone is presumed to
know the law and that the court would not assist a
litigant in the perpetration of a wrongful act, although
it might be presented in the robe of regularity, was
good enough. But according to the ancient report of
this case, even as Banquo’s ghost dispelled the banqueters,
when it was apparent to Macbeth’s fervid imagination,
so this recourse to the old obsolete wager of
law, which allowed an adversary with his friends to
swear his opponent out of court, caused the plaintiff
in this case to abandon his cause, for we are advised
that: “The defendant prepared to bring eleven compurgators,
but the plaintiff abandoned the action.”<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Wager of law was several times invoked in the courts
of the United States and we find that the Supreme
Court considered the nature and limitations of the
practice, as late as the year 1823, in the case of Childress,
plaintiff in error, vs. Emory and McCleur,<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
wherein Mr. Webster, attorney for the plaintiff in error,
in a suit on a note, urged before the court that</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The wager of law has ceased, but many rules of
practice and pleading, founded upon it, have survived,
and have become rules of property, which cannot be
now safely disturbed.... On the English law, it
is clear that debt cannot be maintained in this case,
as the testator might have <i>waged his law</i>, which none
can do who defend in a representative character; hence
it is that in the case of simple contracts, debt has been
superceded by the action of assumpsit, in which, as the
testator could not have <i>waged his law</i>, his executor is
not deprived of any defense which might have been
used by the testator.”</p>

</div>

<p>To this argument, Mr. Hoffman, for the defendant
in error, argued, <i>contra</i>, that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In an action of debt by a merchant stranger, on any
species of simple contract, the defendant was not permitted
to <i>wage his law</i>. Even in those early times, the
courts were strongly disposed to rescue commercial
transactions and dealings from this species of trial,
as may be seen by the intended operation of the
statute <i>de mercatoribus</i>, and particularly in the case
of foreign creditors, who, it was presumed, could not
so easily obtain the requisite evidence, of their claims
as resident merchants; and this may be seen in Godfrey
and Dixon’s case.”<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And Mr. Justice Story, in disposing of the case, <i>inter
alia</i> decided:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now, whatever may be said upon the question,
whether the wager of law was ever introduced into
the common law of our country by the emigration of
our ancestors, it is perfectly clear that it cannot, since
the establishment of the state of Tennessee, have had
a legal existence in its jurisprudence. The constitution
of that state has expressly declared, that the trial by
jury shall remain inviolate; and the constitution of the
United States has also declared that in suits at common<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty
dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.
Any attempt to set up the wager of law would be
utterly inconsistent with this acknowledged right. So
that the wager of law, if it ever had any legal existence
in the United States, is now completely abolished. If,
then, we apply the rule of the common law, to the present
case, we shall arrive, necessarily, at the conclusion,
that the action of debt does lie against the executor,
because the testator could never have waged his law
in this case.”<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And so Mr. Webster’s defense of the <i>wager of law</i>,
to this action on this note, was held not to obtain, and
he lost his case and his client was adjudged to pay the
note of his testator.</p>

<p>If true that but “a hair divides the false and true,”
it is little wonder that for centuries, in the struggle for
right, immersed amid the darkness of the dawn of judicial
procedure, an occasional false note should come
down to us, through the centuries, from the pathetic
drama wherein the individual was made to assert his
right, upon the mere <i>wager of law</i>, instead of more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
accurate human standards to balance the scales of
justice. Judged by our own environment, it seems that
the quarrels of the Universe of old were gauged far
too long by the erroneous standards used in the vain
pursuit of This and That, about which the citizens of
the past centuries endeavoured and disputed. And that
with the institution of trial by jury, brought into existence
in the middle ages, the <i>wager of law</i> would have
much sooner become an obsolete form of procedure.</p>

<p>But in the continuance of the drama of human life,
this prided institution of our twentieth century, may
seem as crude and barbaric to the spectators viewing
the show from the vantage of subsequent centuries,
as this grotesque comedy of errors, known as the <i>wager
of law</i> now appears to us, when we look back upon the
judicial farce enacted by our ancestors, in the uncertain
procedure of Law Wager. They seemed to wander
“in and out, above, about, below,” yet ever missing
the door which led to the correct ideal. They labored
under new and strange conditions, however, and perplexed
as they were with the many problems of the
Human and Divine and intermingling the processes
and procedures of the lay and ecclesiastical courts,
as they did, it is perhaps to their credit that the old
tangles of the law were solved as creditably as they
were.</p>

<p>However this may be, in the <i>Wager of Law</i> we have
but another “story from of old,” in connection with
the perpetual struggle for right, which has followed
man’s course down through the successive generations
of the past.</p>

of debt and detinue and the attempt to demonstrate that this was
because jury trials were inconsistent with the rights of the parties
in these actions, Pollock and Maitland, in their History of English
Law, show that the truth is that these actions are older than jury
trials. (Vol. II., p. 634.)</p>

“The reason wherefore, in an action of debt upon a simple contract,
the defendant may wage his law, is for that the defendant may
satisfy the party in secret, or before witnesses and all the witnesses
may die.” (II. Inst, 45.) But of course this same plea of payment
would be good, whether the debt arose on contract or in parole, and
the same reason would obtain for perpetuating the testimony, and

<p>Compurgation was allowed in a charge of usury, by statute in
Massachusetts, in 1783. (St. Mass. 1783, c. 55.) But in Little vs.

been “substituted for the old trial by oath.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lea, in his excellent work, “Superstition and Force” (3 ed.)
mentions the fact that in South Carolina, an act of the Legislature
of 1712 mentions specific English laws as still in force and enumerates
the law of compurgation, or wager of law, and that in Maryland,
as late as 1811, Chancellor Kilty mentions the fact that wager
of law has gone into disuse, because contrary to our spirit of law,
but does not contend that it had then been specifically abolished,
in Maryland. (Cooper’s Stat. at L. of So. Car. Columbia, 1837, II.,

</div>

<p>Engrossed as the profession is today with the agitation
for the betterment of our remedial procedure, it
will sometimes prove profitable to turn aside from the
progress of our twentieth century procedure and entering
the musty lumber-room of the law, brush aside the
cob-webs and take a cursory view of some of the pleas
that occupied the time of courts and lawyers of past
centuries. Nothing is calculated to encourage more
respect for the modern procedure of American and
English courts, than reading the history of some of
the unequal and unjust privileges and exemptions which
obtained in the administration of the English law, until
a comparatively recent date. The contrast is indeed
striking, when we turn from the just ideals of equality
and justice that characterize the remedial procedure
of our day, to contemplate some of the customs and
pleas that were followed and enforced by our own
courts, before the evolution of our civilization had made
the present ideals possible.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that the English common law
is the outgrowth of the most enlightened system of
jurisprudence that the world has ever seen, for it
represents the best thought of the brightest minds of
civilization’s most progressive people. Its rules and
doctrines were formed, however, during the middle
ages, and although it was generally consistent with
the scholastic methods of thought that dominated the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
thinking world of that period and for the most part,
it was in thorough accord with proper and just ideals,
yet, at the same time, the general doctrines and principles
were applied along with many of the unequal proceedings
and special pleas and privileges existing in
favor of the higher classes and together with the extremely
technical standards, that frequently were
nothing but mere fantastic quibbles.</p>

<p>The benefit of clergy is an illustration of the engraftment
upon this enlightened system of jurisprudence,
of one of the old special privileges of a favored class,
who, as an incident and high prerogative of their office,
claimed exemption from punishment for crimes. Of
course such an exemption of a favored class was inconsistent
with the object of distributive justice, to visit
equal punishment upon all alike who are similarly situated
and with the elevation of the standards of justice
and equality, the plea was finally abolished by the
legislative and judicial branches of Government in
England and the United States.</p>

<p>The benefit of clergy, or <i>privilegium clericale</i>, was
the exemption of the clergy from all responsibility to
the temporal courts and laws from the punishment
imposed for various criminal offenses. Originally the
persons of clergymen alone were held to be exempt
from criminal process before a secular judge, but the
privilege was later extended by the law to all who
could read, as all such were held to be <i>clerica</i>, or clerks.</p>

<p>For many centuries this plea was an important part
of the criminal procedure of the continental countries
of Europe and still furnishes a curious and instructive
part of the history of the laws of England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>The privilege had its origin in a claim made by the
ecclesiastics, at a very early period, for the entire exemption
of their order from the jurisdiction of the
common law courts of England. The growth and development
of the privilege is an interesting chapter
in the history of the controversy between the secular
and spiritual power, during the middle ages and the
limitation or expansion of the authority of the State
or the Church, over matters temporal, depended largely
upon the public sentiment that shaped the policies of
the government and the weakness or strength of the
individuals holding the reigns of government.</p>

<p>Benefit of clergy was the immediate outgrowth of
conditions contributing to the growth of the English
common law. Before the Norman conquest and afterwards,
for many centuries, the clergy took a very active
part in the legislation and judicial branches of
government and they shaped the policies of the government,
in many important respects. The educated class
belonged to this profession and we owe it largely to
them that the Anglo-Saxon law has left us any evidences
at all. During the Saxon period of superstition
and ignorance, the ecclesiastical power had the ascendency,
but it gradually declined, as intellect and education
became the common property of the masses.
Bishops were then the principal members of the courts
of law and they instructed the judges in both the spiritual
and secular laws and the respective limits upon
each.<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The question of ecclesiastical or lay jurisdiction
gave rise to the most intense jealousies and contests
between sovereigns and archbishops and lawyers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
but the superior learning of the clergy resulted in a
gradual encroachment by the Church upon the powers
of the State.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> During the reign of Henry II., the jurisdiction
of the king’s court over criminal clerks was the
subject of a memorable quarrel, between king Henry
and Thomas a’ Becket.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Boniface, Archbishop of
Canterbury, as the successor of Becket, waged a continuous
fight, during the reign of Henry III., to establish
and enlarge the power of the Church, over matters
secular, when clerks or churchmen were brought before
the secular courts. He ordained, under the authority
of a convocation, in 1261, that archbishops,
bishops and other inferior churchmen should ignore
the letters of the king, calling them for trial before
secular courts,<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and before this, in 1253, with other
bishops, he pronounced a sentence of excommunication
against all those who had violated similar provisions
of the canonical laws, while enforcing secular
power.<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>In this civilized age, it seems strange that the Church
would so dominate the State, since the State must have
consented to such a power, or it could not have existed;
but the Church, in this superstitious period of mankind,
held the terror of excommunication over the
heads of the temporal authorities and the State was
thus coerced into the gradual consent to the domination
of the spiritual authorities. The Church always claimed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
exclusive jurisdiction over all spiritual offenses, and
as it held the unfettered power of excommunication,
even though its degrees were opposed to secular laws,
those around whom the Church threw its protecting
arms were really held to be above and beyond the power
of the secular courts.</p>

<p>The power of the Church was based upon a theory of
Divine Right and it was claimed to be far nobler than
that of the State, because, whereas, the power of the
Pope extended to the soul, itself, the power of Princes
was limited to the body alone. The power of the Church,
being thus <i>jure divino</i>, ought to have been limited, at
all times, to matters spiritual, but by a gradual encroachment
and by compact with the powers of the
State, the Church also assumed to exercise authority
over bodies by the aid of the State. But notwithstanding
the firmness with which the clergy claimed the
exemption from all secular interference for the persons
of clerks, and the general indulgence that the laity gave
to this claim, confirmed, as it was by solemn declarations
and acts of Parliament, the privilege was always
viewed with more or less jealousy and considered as
a usurpation that was generously tolerated rather than
as a part and parcel of the established common law of
England.<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Under the terms of the canonical decree, “No power
was given to laymen to judge God’s anointed,”<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> because
laymen, instead of possessing power to command, were
under the Divine injunction to obey the Church and
Churchmen. The clergy was not without a notable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
precedent for this position, for it was recorded that
king Alfred had a judge hanged who had executed a
clerk, because as a secular judge, he must have known
that he had no power over clerks.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Churchmen also found many Bible references as authority
for the privilege. In King David’s psalm of
praise, he cautioned his subjects:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Be ye mindful always of his covenant, and the word
which he commanded to a thousand generations;</p>

<p>Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham
and of his oath unto Isaac;</p>

<p>And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and
to Israel for an everlasting covenant:</p>

<p>He suffered no man to do them wrong; yea, he reproved
kings for their sakes,</p>

<p>Saying, <i>Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets
no harm</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

</div>

<p>One guilty of the crime of high treason was not
entitled to clergy and the exemption was not granted
to those convicted of ordinary misdemeanors.<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> A clergyman
was exempted from capital punishment <i>toties
quoties</i>, as often as he repeated the same offense; for
a second, although it might be a wholly different offense,
he was hanged. But of the laity, peers and
peeresses were discharged for the first offense, without
reading, while commoners, of the male sex, who could
read, were branded in the hand and women commoners
were held not entitled to clergy.<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Nuns, however, were
held entitled to their clergy, at an early day, the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
as the monks and other churchmen, but the privilege,
in contemplation of the law, enured for the benefit of
the church and not for the nun.<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>As the privilege was enforced in more recent times,
after conviction and any time before the execution
of the sentence, when the clerk claimed his clergy, a
priest or ordinary would present him with a “psalter,”
and if he could read his “neck-verse,” he was burned
in the hand and discharged. The first verse of the 51’
Psalm was the verse most generally read to test the
learning of the prisoner and this verse was therefore
called a “neck-verse,” because it decided the fate of
the person claiming clergy, and the neck of the unfortunate
called upon to read this verse depended upon
his ability to read it.<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The rule of law governing the
ordained clerk was that he could not be tried in the lay
courts at all, but only in an ecclesiastical court and
his punishment was governed entirely by that court.
In Bracton’s time, even before conviction in the secular
court, the clerk was delivered when demanded by the
bishop’s court.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> But before the end of the reign of
Henry III. the accused was not delivered until after
his conviction.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>In the time of Edward III., the recognition and enjoyment
of the benefit of clergy, depended entirely upon
the ordinary demanding the felon as a clerk from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
secular authorities.<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> In the reign of Edward IV.,
if the ordinary refused a man his clergy, where he
was able to read, the cause was certified to the King’s
Bench, and the ordinary was fined, on the theory that
he was only a minister of the secular court and not a
judge in the cause.<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> And during the same reign, if the
ordinary granted clergy to a felon who could not read,
the ordinary was fined and the convict hanged and the
secular courts assumed the right to judge of the ability
of the prisoner to read, for they made the record, “<i>quod
legit ut clericus, ideo tradator ordinario</i>” and if the
ordinary granted clergy to one who could not read,
or refused it to one qualified, he was fined.</p>

<p>But the qualification as to reading was not strictly
applied at this period, for if the prisoner could spell
and thus put syllables together, he was held, by Fortescue,
to be entitled to his clergy. Littleton said that
if the clerk refused generally to read, he was denied
his clergy; but if a cause were stated which could not
be allowed by the law of the land, as where he had not
the <i>tonsura clericalis</i> or <i>ornamentum clericale</i>, if clergy
were refused, the ordinary was fined and enjoined to
receive the felon.<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Edward IV. the prisoner claimed
his clergy, upon his arraignment, but this was deemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
prejudicial to the prisoner, for he thus had no challenges
and was denied the right to a trial on the merits
and even if innocent of the crime, if he could not read,
was hanged, and his estate was forfeited. Sir John
Priscott, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas Court,
during the reign of Henry VI. changed the practice
and when the felon claimed his clergy, on arraignment,
he was required to plead to the merits and then, if
convicted, the crown took his estate by forfeiture and
he was then allowed his clergy. This practice served
the double purpose of giving the prisoner the benefit
of a trial on the merits and giving the crown a chance
at his estate, which the other practice denied to the
crown and hence, it was afterwards generally followed.<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>It was customary to keep a register of clerks-convict
and persons attainted, so that such persons might not
have their privilege more than once.<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The burning in the hand, which was a necessary part
of the procedure of the privilege of clergy, was not ordained
by the statute (IV. Henry VII.) as a punishment,
but merely to enable the court, on a subsequent
arraignment of the offender, to ascertain if the defendant
had been accorded his clergy. By statute, during
the reign of Elizabeth (18 Elizabeth), it was enacted
that the prisoner should not be delivered until he had
been burned in the hand, and in Biggen’s case, near the
end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, it was decided,
notwithstanding the statute referred to, that the Queen
could pardon the burning in the hand, but unless she
had done so, the prisoner could not be discharged until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
he had been burned in the hand, and must remain perpetually
in prison.<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The case of one Stone, originating during the fourth
year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, is interesting as
showing the effect of clergy upon crimes committed
preceding the granting of clergy to the criminal. Stone
had committed two felonies in one day, one of which
was clergyable and the other not. He was first indicted
upon the crime which was clergyable and being found
guilty, was admitted to clergy and the judgment was
recorded. Having been adjudged guilty at a subsequent
session upon the non-clergyable felony, the conviction
on the clergyable offense was set up in bar and was
held to be good, by a divided court, seven of the thirteen
deciding that since he had been once placed in jeopardy,
it should not be presumed that the felony for which
clergy was not admissible was committed before the
other and <i>in favorem vitae</i>, the most merciful side
should be taken and though the felony upon which he
was convicted last was committed after the other one,
yet since the felon had suffered judgment upon the
former conviction, as a clerk convict, he should not be
arraigned upon the second indictment, because the
effect of the discharge on the conviction was to acquit
him of all felonies committed before the conviction,
as he should have been arraigned for all his offenses
before his clergy was allowed and the court would be
presumed to have had them in mind, as this was the
duty of the court, and the effect of his clergy was to
discharge him of all preceding felonies.<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>The judgment of the court, in Stone’s case, as to
the effect of clergy upon a preceding crime, was followed
in an early North Carolina case,<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> where the
court held that if the defendant claimed clergy for an
offense committed before clergy was granted to him,
this claim should be urged the same as a pardon, when
the prisoner was brought up for judgment on the latter
conviction.</p>

<p>The distinction between “clergyable” and “unclergyable”
crimes was not so clearly defined during the
thirteenth century, as at a later period. At this time
the benefit of clergy was but the privilege of “ordained
clerks” and the legislation of king John’s reign shows
that the exemption was slowly and by degrees ordained
as not applicable to the crime of high treason.<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> While
the exemption to the clerks of the twelfth century was
much broader than later, during the thirteenth century
clerks could be tried for all minor offenses and in Bracton’s
day clerks were answerable to civil process the
same as the laity.<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The clergy had so far established
the exemption of their persons from corporal pains,
that during the reign of Henry III. it was enacted that
a clerk, taken for the death of a man, or for any other
crime, if demanded by the ordinary, was to be immediately
delivered, without inquisition, to the court
Christian, to make canonical purgation and to establish
his innocence or stand convicted.<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Edward I., the practice established<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
during the reign of Henry III., that a clerk, convicted
of felony, could be delivered to the ordinary, was
recognized by act of Parliament (Statute Westminster),
and this statute recited this privilege and simply admonished
the prelates not to liberate those so delivered
to them, without putting them to their canonical purgation.<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
In the 25’ year of Edward III. the clergy
complained to Parliament that a certain knight, entitled
to clergy, had been hanged and quartered, on a
judgment of treason and that a priest had been hanged
for killing his master. These complaints led to the
enactment of the statute <i>De Clero</i> (25 Edward III.
st. 3) by the terms of which it was provided that
henceforth all manner of clerks, as well secular as religious,
convicted before any secular justice, for treason
or felony, touching other persons than the king himself
or his royal majesty, should freely have and enjoy
the privilege of the holy church and should, without
any impeachment or delay, be delivered to the ordinary
demanding them.<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Henry VII. (7 Henry VII., c. 1),
the benefit of clergy was taken away from persons convicted
of desertion while under enlistment as soldiers
of the crown and the privilege was likewise taken away
from those convicted of petit treason. The exemption
of the clergy from punishment for crimes was given
a most decided set-back by the statute 4’ Henry VIII.,
c. 2, which provided that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All persons committing murder or felony, in any
church, chapel, or hallowed place; or who, of malice
prepens, rob or murder any person in the king’s highway,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
or rob or murder any person in his house, the
owner or dweller of the house, his wife, child or servant
being then therein, and put in fear or dread, shall
not be admitted to clergy.”</p>

</div>

<p>This statute contained no exception of those actually
engaged in the holy orders and this led to the most
determined resistence on the part of the clergy of the
kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Henry VIII. stood firm, however, and
during the same reign another statute was passed
(23 Henry VIII., c. 1), taking away the benefit of
clergy from persons convicted of petit treason, wilful,
malicious murder, robbery, wilful burning of a dwelling
house, or barn, where grain or corn was stored, and
the like privilege was denied to the abettors, helpers,
maintainers or counselors of such felons, except only
such as were within the holy orders. It was also made
a felony, without clergy, for a clerk convict to break
prison and escape, and this was a serious blow to the
exemption, for though the lives of the clergy were
spared, after conviction of the offenses named, yet they
were to be condemned to imprisonment and even to
death, if the ordinary so directed.<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>By 27 Henry VIII., c. 17, clergy was also taken away
from servants who embezzled their master’s goods or
property, and by 28 Henry VIII., c. 1, persons under
holy orders were to be judged the same as those not
under holy orders, so that real clerks were subjected
to capital punishment for felony, the same as nominal
clerks.<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> During the same reign, by statute 33 Henry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
VIII., c. 1 to 14, clergy was denied to persons practicing
witchcraft or enchantment and to those making prophesies
upon coates of arms, badges, etc.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Before the
reign of Elizabeth, the granting or recording clergy
had been reduced to a mere formality, but by 18’ Elizabeth,
it was provided that the temporal courts should
not deliver the prisoner, until he had been burned in
the hand.<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Benefit of clergy was not abolished, in England,
until the year 1825, when, by statute, 7 George IV., c.
28, sec. 6, this ancient privilege of the middle ages
was abolished, in that country.</p>

<p>In the United States, by Act of Congress, April 30’,
1790, it was provided that the benefit of clergy should
not be allowed upon conviction for any crime where,
by statute, the punishment was death. In North Carolina,
in 1816, the punishment by burning in the hand
was abrogated, and, in Kentucky, the benefit of clergy
was abolished, by statute, in 1847.<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>The celebrated case of Doctor Horsey, Chancellor
to the Bishop of London, who, during the reign of
Henry VIII., was prosecuted and adjudged guilty of
the murder of John Hunne, is one of the most interesting
that has come to the writer’s attention. On
account of the well known position of Doctor Standish,
as an advocate of the temporal power, the clergy concluded
not to wait upon the procedure of the temporal
courts, in Doctor Horsey’s case, but they caused a
charge of heresy to be lodged against Doctor Standish,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
because of his advocacy of the power of the temporal
courts over the persons and punishment of clerks. The
clergy and the justices of the King’s Courts had a notable
dispute concerning the power of the temporal courts
over the persons of clerks, the clergy contending that
the benefit of clergy was established by the express
command of Jesus Christ, in the words, <i>nolite tangere
Christos meos</i>, while the temporal justices argued that
these were the words of King David, not of the Saviour
at all, and that the “anointed,” referred to the believers,
to distinguish them from the unbelievers, then
abroad in Palestine. Those who had proceeded against
Doctor Standish were adjudged guilty of a <i>praemunire</i>,
when Cardinal Wolsey threw himself at the king’s feet
and beseeched him to withhold his decision until the
Pope could be heard from. King Henry, however,
decided that the arguments of the supporters of Doctor
Standish had not been answered by the clergy and
concluded with all of his accustomed firmness:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By the order and sufferance of God, we are king of
England; and the kings of England who have gone
before us never had any superior but God alone; and,
therefore, know that we will maintain the right of our
crown and temporal jurisdiction, as well in this point
as in others, in as ample a manner as our predecessors
have done before us.”<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This decisive stand of the King concluded the agitation
concerning the conflict of authority over the case
of Doctor Horsey. Doctor Standish was discharged
from the charge of heresy. Doctor Horsey was so far
rescued from temporal power, however, that he enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
the free custody of the house of the Archbishop
of Canterbury, until the popular clamor had subsided,
when he was privately surrendered to the court of
King’s Bench and having entered a plea of not guilty,
it was confessed and the defendant was discharged.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Although the clergy thus failed to convince Henry
VIII. of the true foundation of its power, in the case
of Doctor Standish, it lost none of its authority against
the temporal courts, in the case of Doctor Horsey, but
its jurisdiction and the benefit of clergy was practically
conceded by the judges of the king’s court and the
privilege continued to be recognized until the 23’ year
of this king’s reign, when he waged war against the
whole papal authority and passed an act taking away
the benefit of clergy from murder and robbery, in certain
cases.<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>One of the most distinguished men known to have
been accorded the benefit of clergy, in England, was
the gifted Ben Jonson, the friend of “gentle Shakespeare”
and the scholarly Lord Bacon. He was arraigned
at the Old Bailey, in October, 1598, for the
manslaughter of Gabriel Spencer, in a duel. The indictment
charged that the defendant, at Shordiche, had,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“with a certain sword of iron and steel called a rapiour,
of the price of 3s., which he then and there had in his
right hand and held drawn, feloniously and wilfully
struck the same Gabriel then and there with the aforesaid
sword, giving to the same Gabriel Spencer, in and
upon the same Gabriel’s right side a mortal wound, of
the depth of six inches and of the bredth of one inch,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
of which mortal wound the same Gabriel then and
there died instantly.”<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The record in this same case further shows that the
prisoner when arraigned,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Confessed the indictment, asked for the book, read
like a clerk, was marked with the letter T, and delivered
according to the form of the statute,”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">which meant that the author of “Every Man in His
Humor” had claimed and been accorded the benefit
of clergy; that he had been branded on the left thumb
with a T, generally known as the Tyburn T, and discharged.<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The benefit of clergy was set up and recognized in
many criminal cases in the United States, during the
Colonial period and the great patriot, James Otis, successfully
urged the exemption in favor of Massachusetts
soldiers, convicted of murder for their participation
in the Boston massacre.<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The Federal Court
decided, in the year 1817, in the case of United States
vs. Lambert,<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> that a person convicted of bigamy, in
Alexandria, was entitled to clergy, and, if able to read,
should be burned in the hand and recognized for good
subsequent behaviour. In the year 1830, the Federal
Court held, in the case of United States vs. Jernegan<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[42]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
that on a conviction for bigamy, in granting the benefit
of clergy, it was discretionary with the trial court to
dispense with the burning in the hand.</p>

<p>In the year 1806 the Supreme Court of North Carolina
held that females could claim the benefit of clergy,
the same as males.<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The Legislature of North Carolina,
having, in 1816 passed a statute abolishing the
punishment of “burning in the hand” for clergyable
felonies, the Supreme Court of that state, construing
this statute, in 1825, in the case of State vs. Yeater,<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
held that corporal punishment and imprisonment could
not both be inflicted upon a person found guilty of the
crime of manslaughter.</p>

<p>In 1837, however, in the same state the same court
held that one found guilty of manslaughter could be
burned in the hand and also imprisoned for one year.
And in the year 1855, the Supreme Court of North
Carolina held that when a new felony was created by
statute, the privilege of clergy was an incident thereto,
unless it was expressly taken away by the statute
creating the offense.<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> And in State vs. Carroll,<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> the
same court held that when the defendant prayed the
benefit of clergy, for a clergyable offense, if the State
objected because the defendant had before had clergy,
this objection must be set up by a plea in writing.</p>

<p>In State vs. Sutcliff,<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> decided in South Carolina, in
1855, a defendant, convicted of burning a dwelling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
house, was held entitled to the benefit of clergy, and in
the same state, the same year, another person convicted
of arson in the nighttime, was held entitled to clergy.<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>In Indiana, in 1820, and in Minnesota, in 1859, the
Supreme Courts of those states held that the benefit
of clergy did not and never had existed in those commonwealths,<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
and in the year 1787 the Supreme Court
of Virginia held that the crime of arson was not a
clergyable offense in the courts of that state.<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> But
in the same state, in 1795, two persons were convicted
for stealing a horse, in 1793, and before the <i>sentence of
death</i> was pronounced, they both prayed the benefit
of clergy and the Supreme Court held that they were
entitled to clergy.<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>One of the last cases where clergy was recognized, in
the United States, was in a Kentucky case.<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> A negro
was convicted of rape upon a white woman, after a
trial had before Judge Buckner, in Bonner County,
at Glasgow. Under the statute, the punishment to be
assessed was death and the judge believed the defendant
innocent of the crime for which he had been
convicted. The defendant’s counsel claimed the benefit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
of clergy for him and the defendant was found able
to read the Constitution of the United States and he
was accordingly burned in the hand and discharged.</p>

<p>These instances are not nearly all that could be
found in England or the United States to illustrate
the application of this exemption from crime, at common
law, but the random cases mentioned will show
the general recognition of the privilege until comparatively
recent times.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but what the benefit of clergy bred
much crime and operated, for centuries, as a great
impediment in the impartial enforcement of the criminal
laws of England and the United States. Like the
right of sanctuary, established by the early Saxon
kings, the benefit of clergy owed its existence to the fact
that the law’s redress of wrongs was, at an early period
in the history of the world, inadequate to protect the
educated class from the ambition and cupidity of the
race and in the dangerous games for place and power
then waged, these privileges were very dear to Englishmen
and on the whole, were strictly respected.</p>

<p>Judged by modern standards, the exemption of the
clergy, enlarged to include all those who could read,
from the punishment that others, similarly situated,
were subjected to, who were not so fortunate as to
be able to read, seems an anomaly in the administration
of any system of justice; but it must be accepted as
a mere incident of the barbarous period when the privilege
was applied.</p>

<p>As a doctrine of the common law, it illustrates the
fallibility of all institutions of man, both in and out
of the holy orders. The privilege had neither justice nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
reason for its foundation, but, like the practice of witchcraft,
enchantment and the belief in ghosts, so prevalent
during the same period, it owed its existence to the
ignorance and superstition of that civilization. Because
of such an unjust practice the common law is not to
be condemned, any more than is the literature of the
same period of English history, because of the introduction
of ghosts, witchcraft and enchantment, into
the literary masterpieces of the past centuries, for
these beliefs were prevalent at that time.</p>

<p>The Benefit of Clergy was an institution of the
“myriads who, before us, pass’d the door of darkness
through.” No doubt some of our institutions and
procedure, to the jurists of succeeding ages, that come
and go, “upon this chequer-board of nights and days,”
will seem equally as unjust and ridiculous as this institution
of the past now appears to us. We should
congratulate ourselves, that with our own liberal constitution,
founded upon a more exact idea of distributive
justice, we are able to “grasp this sorry scheme
of things,” which existed until the present century.
But that this institution continued until the past century,
ought to prevent our entire satisfaction with our
own procedure, and urge us to the improvement of our
present laws.</p>

<p>Kelying reports a case, where at the Lent Assizes, for Winchester,
the clerk appointed by the bishop to give clergy for the prisoners,
charged with larceny, delivered the book to the prisoner and the
prisoner did not look at the book at all, but when asked, “<i>legit</i> or

<p>That Thackeray was thoroughly familiar with the law governing
the Benefit of Clergy and the nature of the punishment
inflicted on the culprit pleading guilty of an offense clergyable at
common law, is evidenced by his presentation of the plea in favor
of Lord Mohun, the Earl of Warwick, Col. Westbury and Henry
Esmond, in his interesting plot, in “Henry Esmond.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br>
<span class="smcap">Privilege of Sanctuary.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The privilege of sanctuary, sometimes called the privilege
of asylum, was the exemption afforded criminals,
taking refuge in certain consecrated places, from the
ordinary operation of the law of arrest.</p>

<p>The institution is no doubt older than the time of
Moses and we find frequent references to it in the early
books of the Bible.</p>

<p>In the book of Exodus the old Mosaic law was stated
to be: “He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall
be surely put to death,” but in the same book, it is
written: “And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver
him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place
whither he shall flee.”</p>

<p>Moses’ law thus distinguished between murder on
malice aforethought and mere manslaughter, as we
call it and according to the ancient law of the Israelites,
there were cities of refuge to which a felon might
flee, who killed a man unawares.</p>

<p>Moses appointed six cities of refuge, three “on this
side of Jordan” and three “in the land of Canaan,”
in order that the slayer might flee thither which should
kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times
past; and that fleeing to one of these cities, he might
live.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>Deuteronomy refers to the case of “the slayer which
shall flee thither that he may live”; distinguishing the
man who lies in wait, from the man who “killeth his
neighbour innocently, whom he hated not in times
past.”<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>In the book of Joshua it is provided that “When he
that doth flee to one of those cities shall stand at the
entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his
cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall
take him into the city unto them and give him a place,
that he may dwell among them. And if the avenger of
blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the
slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour
unwittingly and hated him not beforetime.”<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Over a thousand years before Christ we find Adonijah
claiming the privilege of sanctuary to protect him
from the wrath of Solomon, for it is recorded in the
first book of Kings:<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and
arose, and went and caught hold on the horns of the
altar. And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah
feareth king Solomon, for, lo, he hath caught hold
on the horns of the altar, saying: Let king Solomon
swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant
with the sword. And Solomon said: If he will shew
himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him
fall to the earth; but if wickedness shall be found in
him, he shall die.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>This case of Adonijah taking refuge in the temple,
at the altar, as a protection against the supposed wrath
of Solomon, is nothing more nor less than a claim of
sanctuary, for even the hand of Solomon was stayed at
the threshold of such a consecrated place and the sinner
taking refuge at the altar was supposed to be surrounded
by the protecting mantle of the Great Jehovah.
This is only one of many thousand similar concrete
cases that could be mentioned, no doubt, if the unwritten
history of the unnoticed millions of patriarchial
days could be known, for the right of sanctuary obtained
generally in those ancient days. The ever-flowing
flood of time has swept away all records of the ordinary
mortals, however, and only the great peer out
through the darkness of the past.</p>

<p>The conditions upon which sanctuary was bestowed,
in the ancient days of the patriarchs was that the refugee
should not quit the city of refuge until the death
of the High Priest, for on this solemn occasion, the
great public grief was supposed to over-shadow all
merely private affairs. As recorded in the book of
Joshua, one claiming sanctuary must stand at the gate
of the city and “declare his cause in the ears of the
elders”<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>; the elders tried his case, to ascertain if he
were guilty of malicious murder, or mere manslaughter,
and if the case of murder was established by the
“avenger of blood,” who acted as prosecutor, the criminal
was given up, even though he clung to the altar,<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
but if the elders found that he was not guilty of wilful
murder, he was retained as “a prisoner at large” in
the city of refuge, until the demise of the High Priest,
when he was allowed to return to his home, duly purged
of the crime for which he had fled. If he departed from
the “city of refuge” before the death of the High
Priest, however, he was regarded as an outlaw and
could be slain by any man, as such.<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>According to Plutarch and Dr. Pegge, the right of
sanctuary was recognized among the ancient Greeks
and the Oratory of Theseus was one of the places of
refuge for persons of lowly station, who fled to avoid
the oppression of the great and powerful “avengers of
blood.” The privilege afforded these lowly ones soon
became a license for the protection of criminals, however,
and the most notorious criminals were protected
from the civil authorities and the holy places and
temples came to be used as asylums and resorts for
the most notorious criminals.<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>From Greece, the right of sanctuary spread to Rome,
and although, by the Roman law, murderers, escaped
slaves, robbers, and public debtors were excluded from
sanctuary privileges,<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> in the course of time, the priests
refused to deliver up the slaves to their masters, the
debtors to their creditors, or the murderers to the
magistrates, and the temples and churches became regular
dens for thieves, murderers and criminals of the
worst kind.<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Long after the civilizations of the ancient Jews and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
Grecians had passed away, the privilege of sanctuary,
which they recognized, was perpetuated in various
forms, and in most of the later civilizations we find
evidences of similar customs obtaining.</p>

<p>Before the privilege of sanctuary was guaranteed by
written statute law, the right was recognized by the
general usage of the Christian church, in accordance
with the early Mosaic law and in all the countries whose
civilization borrowed from the ancient Israelites, there
is evidence of such a custom.</p>

<p>The Emperor Constantine, as early as the year 324
caused laws to be enacted, extending and recognizing
the privilege of sanctuary; Theodosus, in the year 392,
made a law regulating the exemption to criminals of
his day and Theodosus II. extended the freedom of
sanctuary, from the altar and body of the church itself,
to which it was previously confined, to all the buildings
and places contained within the outer walls of the
consecrated places, set apart for purposes of sanctuary.<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Although the fact is not established by competent
authority, it has been stated that the privilege of sanctuary
obtained in England, as early as the close of
the second century after Christ.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The right may have
been recognized as early as this date, but the history
of the period does not give us any very authentic record
to sustain that it did. Soon after the conversion of
the Saxons to Christianity, however, all places of public
worship were looked upon as so consecrated that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
criminals taking refuge in any of them were temporarily
protected from the process of the civil authorities.<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Unlike the ancient Jews, the early Saxons received
even the felons guilty of wilful murder, for a period
of thirty days, if they paid the <i>Wehrgeld</i>, fixed by the
officers of the church, according to the standing of the
person killed; he was protected from the civil authorities
for a period of thirty days, on payment of the
<i>Wehrgeld</i>, if he provided his own sustenance, after
which he was delivered to his friends.<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>As sanctuary was only extended to those, under the
Mosaic law, who “declared their cause in the ears of
the elders of the city,” so, under the Anglo-Saxon
law, the criminal claiming sanctuary was required to
confess his crime and declare that he sought the safety
of the church to preserve his life.<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Under the old Saxon law, however, the privilege was
not extended for a longer period than forty days and
at the end of that time, if the prisoner did not <i>abjure
the realm</i>, he was delivered to his friends, or to the civil
authorities. Under the practice known as <i>abjuration
of the realm</i> if the sanctuary felon, within forty days
after taking sanctuary, went, in sackcloth, before the
coroner and confessed his guilt and took an oath to quit
the realm and not to return, without the king’s license,
he was then attainted of the felony, but was given an
additional period of forty days to prepare for his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
journey and to keep the privilege alive, he was compelled,
within this period, to repair, with a cross in his
hand, as an indicia of his crime, but an emblem of the
protection afforded him by the church, to the port assigned
him, and to there take his journey for some
foreign shore.<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Large numbers of the English felons, at an early day,
by this practice known as <i>abjuration of the realm</i>, were
induced to leave England and annually many such “undesirable
citizens” took passage from Dover, to France
or Flanders, under the threat of delivery to the civil authorities,
to answer for their crime, if they did not voluntarily
assume this perpetual banishment and suffer
the forfeiture of their estate to the crown.<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>After <i>abjuration of the realm</i>, if the prisoner afterwards
returned to England, without the license of the
king, so to do, he was regarded as an outlaw and, when
caught, was condemned to be hanged, unless he was a
clerk, in which event, he was allowed to claim the
<i>benefit of clergy</i>, and to be discharged, after the usual
preliminaries and the punishment inflicted upon those
claiming clergy for such a crime as the sanctuary criminal
had committed.<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<p>During the period of the forty days, while the criminal
was enjoying his privilege of sanctuary, the <i>villata</i>
where the crime was committed was required to watch
the sanctuary, to prevent his escape, without <i>abjuration
of the realm</i>; if the coroner did not come for the period
of forty days, the township was required to watch the
church for this full period and if the criminal escaped,
because of the failure to do so, the township was
amerced accordingly.<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The privilege of sanctuary was recognized by the code
of Ina, King of West Saxony, in 693, and the fifth section
of the code provides that if a felon, who had been
convicted of a capital offense fled to a church, or sanctuary,
his life should be spared and if any criminal adjudged
to be flogged, sought refuge in such consecrated
place, the stripes, that he would otherwise receive,
should be withheld from him.<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>In the year 887, under a statute of Alfred the
Great, the privilege of three nights was allowed the
criminal seeking the protection of the church, to enable
him to prepare for his safety, and by this same provision
of the law, if anyone violated the privilege of
sanctuary, during the period named, by inflicting blows,
wounds, or bonds, upon the sanctuary criminal, he was
obliged to pay the sum of One hundred and twenty shillings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
to the ministers of the church, whose precincts had
been invaded.<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The Mirror of Justice, reports that King Alfred
caused a judge to be hanged, who had invaded the jurisdiction
of the holy orders and removed, by civil process,
a criminal who had sought the protection of
sanctuary<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and it is certain that the right was not only
safe-guarded by the law, in the time of Alfred, but that
Ethelred and all subsequent Saxon kings expressly
sanctioned the privilege.<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>With the advent of William the Conqueror, the law
of sanctuary, with the other Saxon laws that he did not
repeal, became more fixed and definite, but the extent
of the privilege was more or less varied, by the laws
or practices of the different subsequent kings.</p>

<p>After the conquest the practice obtained of erecting
a stone seat, beside the altar and several of these seats
were erected in the English churches, and criminals
fleeing to these seats were protected by the peace of
the church, <i>pax ecclesiae</i>, and guarded by all its sanctity.
To violate the protection afforded by this seat,
or of the shrine of relics, was an offense too grave to be
compensated by the payment of a mere money fine.
One of these seats of stone still remains at Beverly and
another at Hexham.</p>

<p>The privilege at Beverley was granted by Athelstan
and extended for a radius of a mile around St. John’s
as the center. The outward and next outer boundaries
of this circle were designated by crosses of rich carving.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
The third boundary began at the entrance to the church
and the sixth embraced the high altar and the “fridstool.”<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>In the four roads leading to the monastery of Hexham,
in Northumberland, the boundary stones were
rude crosses, around which, in Saxon characters and
letters was the word “Sanctuarium,” which meant so
much to the criminals of early times, seeking the protection
of the “Chair of Peace.”</p>

<p>The “fridstool” at Hexham has been carefully preserved
and is much more extensive and handsome than
that at Beverly, as it has interlaced Saxon and Norman
ornaments on the top of the chair and a moulding extends
below and around the seat.<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span></p>

<p>At Durham, the privilege extended to the church, the
churchyard and the circuit. All who came within this
solemn circle were protected, for the church was supposed
to throw around them its protecting arms and the
penalties for intruding upon this “charmed circle,” increased
in proportion as the degree of holiness was desecrated.<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>William the Conqueror granted the charter to St.
Martin’s le Grand and by the charter the privilege extended
not only to the church, but to the college of St.
Martin and the precincts thereof.<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Westminster, perhaps the most famous sanctuary in
England, received its charters from two of the kings of
the Heptarchy and Edward the Confessor attempted to
forever establish it as one of the perpetual sanctuaries
of England, for all classes of criminals, in the following
broad grant:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I order and establish, forever, that what person, of
what condition or estate soever he be, from whence soever
he come, or for what offence or cause it be, either
for his refuge in the said holy place, he be assured of
his life, liberty and limbs. And over this, I forbid, under
the pain of everlasting damnation, that no minister
of mine, or of my successors, intermeddle with any the
goods, lands, or possessions of the said persons taking
the said sanctuary.... And whomsoever presumes
or doth contrary to this my graunt I will he lose
his name, worship, dignity and power and that with the
great traitor Judas, that betrayed our Saviour, he be
in everlasting fire of hell; and I will and ordain that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
this my graunt endure as long as there remaineth in
England, either love or dread of Christian name.”<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

</div>

<p>So essential was it then regarded to maintain, at all
hazards, the <i>pax ecclesiae</i>, that the red handed murderer,
even, when he once reached the sacred precincts
of the church’s domain, was to be protected from the
mere temporal powers of the earth, because he thus
placed his faith in a higher law and the mundane
officers of the law, for attempting to preserve the peace
of the realm, if they transgressed upon the sacred soil
consecrated to the Lord and used also for the protection
of criminals, were classed along with traitors to
the Lord and a dire curse proclaimed against them. It
is well for the race that such delusions have passed
away, along with the delusions of witchcraft and other
fanaticisms of that age.</p>

<p>The Whitefriars, or Alsatia, an establishment of the
Carmelites, was founded by Sir Patrick Grey, in the
year 1241, upon a plot of ground, granted by Edward I.,
on Fleet street, located between what is now Salisbury
street and the Temple, and Fleet street and the river
Thames.<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>According to the law, as it finally developed, if a
man fled to any one of the many sanctuaries, <i>chartered
by the Crown</i>, and claimed protection from the civil authorities
for a crime he had committed, regardless of
the enormity of his crime, he could remain there undisturbed,
for life and was not obliged to make his
<i>abjuration of the realm</i>, as he was required to do in case
the asylum was not such a chartered institution. Many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
of these chartered asylums were established, and aside
from those mentioned, there were sanctuaries so chartered
at Wells, Norwich, York, Manchester, Derby,
Lancaster and Northampton.<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>In the absence of a special charter, however, the
crime of treason was not a sanctuary crime and traitors
were not protected, even though they sought the portals
of such consecrated places.<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Edward I., about the year 1262,
the Abbot of Westminster attempted to extend the privilege
of sanctuary, to those guilty of treason, to debtors
and other classes of criminals than those who had formerly
enjoyed the right and he also contended that the
civil officers were not allowed, under the conditions of
the charter of that institution, to enter upon any places,
however remote, that belonged to the abbey. A law suit
resulted and notwithstanding the broad terms of the
charter above quoted, it was decided by all the justices
that sanctuary was confined to felons alone and that
the sheriffs of London had a right to enter the town
of Westminster and to proceed to the very gates of the
abbey and to enter the houses of the abbey elsewhere
in the county, to arrest felons.<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<p>The class of criminals who sought protection under
the right of sanctuary, included the whole gamut of
crimes known to English law, murder or homicide, debt,
horse and cattle stealing, housebreaking, or burglary,
escaping from prison, rape, harbouring a thief, treason,
receiving stolen goods, counterfeiting, larceny and the
other crimes common in the realm and made so by
statute, or existing at common law.</p>

<p>During the reign of Henry VII., it was decreed that
when an offender fled to sanctuary, it was not enough
for him to declare that he came there to save his life, but
he must add that he had committed a felony; though
he need not specify the felony, before the coroner
came.<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> But if he failed to make such a general declaration,
he could be dragged from the sanctuary and
was not exempt from civil process.<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span></p>

<p>The system whereby the felon fled to sanctuary and
was accorded the privilege is described in the literature
of the period descriptive of the manner of enjoying
this right.</p>

<p>A knocker was usually provided at the outer door of
the abbey and one or two janitors roomed above the
door, to admit such nocturnal visitors as called at different
hours to claim their sanctuary. After the refugee
was admitted to the sanctuary, the Galilee Bell
was tolled, to announce to the outer world that another
sanctuary criminal had been admitted. A gown of
black cloth, with a yellow cross, was given to the culprit
to wear and he was disarmed and assigned to his quarters.<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The oath administered to the refugee has been preserved
by the Harleian Manuscripts<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and a form of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
confession and abjuration, administered by Sir William
Rastall, Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas
during the reign of Queen Mary, has been handed down
to us.<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>While the right was held not to extend to cases of
treason, generally, in different reigns, we find that it
was extended to include treason, as well as the lesser
felonies.</p>

<p>Henry IV. wrote a letter to Cardinal Langley, which
is preserved in the Treasury,<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> wherein that monarch
respected the privilege of sanctuary, even in a case of
treason, and asked the protection of St. Cuthbert for
the person of Robert Marshall, “late comitted to prison
for treason, now escaped and broken into the same into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
youre church of Duresme; we having tender zele and
devocion to the honour of God and St. Cuthbert, ...
wol that for that occasion nothyng be attempted that
shal be contrarie to the liberties and immunitie of our
church. We therefor wol and charge you that he be
surely kept there, as ye wol answere unto us for him.—Yeven
under our signet at our towne of Stanford, the
xxvii day of July.”</p>

<p>There was flagrant breach of the ancient privilege of
sanctuary, in England, in 1378, in the case of Sir
Robert Haule and Sir John Shackle. Having escaped
from the Tower, these gentlemen took refuge in Westminster.
Boxhall, the constable of the Tower, with fifty
armed men pursued them and although the celebration
of mass was in progress, when they entered the abbey,
they pursued the prisoners and although Sir John
Shackle escaped, they killed Sir Robert Haule, by hacking
him, with their swords, while he ran around the
choir, until he fell dead, with twelve serious wounds,
near the prior’s cell.<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Owen Tudor, the father of Henry VII. took refuge at
Westminster and Queen Elizabeth, the widow of Edward
IV., with her son, also took sanctuary there to
escape the ferocity of her inhuman brother-in-law,
Richard III.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas More gives a graphic account of the
sanctuary of Elizabeth:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Therefore now she (Queen Elizabeth Woodville)
toke her younger sonne the Duke of Yorke and her
daughters, and went out of the Palays of Westminster,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
into the Sanctuary and there lodged in the Abbote’s
Hac and she and all her children and campaignie were
registered for Sanctuary persons. Whereupon, the
Bishop (Lord Chancellor Rotheram, Archbishop of
Yorke) called up all his servants and took with him the
great seal and came before day to the Queen, about
whom he found much heavyness, rumble, haste, businesse,
conveighaunce, and carriage of her stuffe into
Sanctuary. Every man was busy to carry, bear, conveigh,
stuffe, chestes, and fardelles, no man was unoccupied,
and some carried more than they were commanded
to another place. The Queene sat belowe on
the rushes, all desolate and dismayed.”<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

</div>

<p>A pathetic picture, of this poor widowed Queen, sitting
all alone, amid the green rushes, a refugee from
the ferocity of her wolfish brother-in-law. One devoid
of chivalry and possessing only common human instincts
of pity would have offered protection to a lady
in such sad plight, but history does not record it of
“Crookbacked Richard,” for he determined early to
prove a villain and, to clothe his naked villany “with
old odd ends stol’n forth of holy writ”; he seemed a
saint, when most he played the devil and was not only
devoid of pity for others, but found, in himself, no pity
for himself.<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>An instance of the temporary violation of the royal
charter privileges granted to St. Martin’s le Grand, occurred
in September, 1442, when an officer was conducting
a prisoner from Newgate to Guildhall. When
they reached Panyer Alley five of the prisoner’s friends
rushed out and rescued him from the officer and took
him to St. Martin’s claiming sanctuary. The sheriffs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
of London went to the Church and not only took the
prisoner, but all five of his friends, with chains round
their necks to Newgate. The matter was brought before
the King’s Star Chamber, by the Dean and Chapter
of St. Martin’s le Grand and the claim advanced
that the ancient charter privileges of the Church had
been violated by the Sheriffs and the King ordered the
men to be sent back to St. Martin’s “there to abide
freely, as in a place having franchises, whiles them
liked.”<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Henry VII., the interesting case
of Humphrey Stafford, was decided, wherein the right
of sanctuary, in treason, was expressly denied. Stafford
had been attainted of treason and claimed sanctuary
but was taken from the sanctuary and imprisoned
in the Tower. When brought to the Bar of the King’s
Bench, he pleaded his right of sanctuary, but after
solemn discussion and reflection, the judges gave a
unanimous decision that treason was such an exalted
crime against the prerogatives of the King, that it
could not be included within the crimes for which
sanctuary would be allowed, and they disregarded the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
ancient charters to the contrary and gave judgment that
Stafford should be executed.<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>It was attempted to have this holding reviewed the
year following the decision, when the Abbot of Abingdon
appeared before the judges and produced his
ancient charters, upon which he claimed his privileges
were founded and the whole issue was gone into in
exchequer chamber, before the judges. The Abbot
claimed that the judges should confer with the prelates
before pronouncing judgment, but one of the
judges replied that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There can be no franchise without grant from the
king. For the king can grant that any person who
enters such a place, having committed treason, shall
not be taken therefrom. And this shows that it can be
done without the assent of Pope or Bishop, and that
the Pope cannot do it within this realm. For to pardon
or dispense with treason, pertains exclusively to the
king. And a place of safety, is as a <i>privilege</i>, not as
sanctuary. But when the Pope has consecrated the
place, then it is sanctuary, not before.... But
the principle of protection arises by our law, of which
the cognizance belongs to us.”</p>

</div>

<p>And this view obtaining, the Abbot was denied his suit
and it was finally held that no right of sanctuary existed
in case of a charge of treason.<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Illustrating the growing tendency to limit the privilege
of sanctuary during the reign of Henry VII.,
another significant case, will not be studied in vain.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
Two felons were taken out of sanctuary, at Southwark
and when arraigned for their crimes before Sir
Thomas Frowike, Chief Justice, they pleaded their
sanctuary and prayed to be restored. They were commanded
to plead to the felonies with which they were
charged, on the merits, but refused, claiming that as
they were wrongfully taken out of sanctuary they were
bound to plead to the indictment; the court, however,
found that they had not been taken out of sanctuary and
then, without arraigning them again, ordered that they
be subjected to the terrible <i>peine forte et dure</i>, for
standing mute and refusing to plead. So final judgment
was entered, notwithstanding their right to sanctuary,
that they be taken to the jail, from whence they
came, and laid upon the bare ground, and that so much
weight be laid upon them as they could suffer and more,
and that they should have nothing to eat but bread and
water; and that so they should be kept, continually,
until they died.<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>As indicative of the cruelty and barbarism then obtaining,
this judgment is an important index and that
such a judgment should have been rendered against
men claiming the privilege of sanctuary, was not only
contrary to the law of <i>peine forte et dure</i>, which punishment
was only assessed upon those standing mute and
refusing to plead at all, and not to those claiming an
exemption given them by such a well settled custom
approved by the laws and decisions of the courts for
many centuries, but it was certainly contrary to the
spirit and intent of the law and condemns the judges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
pronouncing such a harsh judgment, even unto this
late day.</p>

<p>In Scotland, by the ancient canons of the Scottish
Councils, much more sacredness was attached to the
plea of sanctuary, than obtained during this period of
English history. Excommunication was there incurred
for the offense of taking criminals from sanctuaries
and depriving them of the protection of the church.
Scottish kings granted charters recognizing broader
privileges in certain churches than in others, and many
particular ecclesiastical asylums were established in
Scotland, by special charters.</p>

<p>One of the most celebrated sanctuaries in Scotland
was the church of Wedale, now called Stow, for in this
church there was an image of the blessed Virgin, believed
to have been brought by King Arthur, from
Jerusalem. David I., of Scotland, granted the “king’s
peace,” in addition to the church’s protection, to those
refugees taking sanctuary at the church of Lesmahagow,
and it was, for centuries, one of the most prominent
sanctuaries of Scotland.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable features of the custom of
sanctuary, obtaining in Scotland, was that of the <i>Clan
Macduff</i>, alleged to have been granted by Malcolm
Canmore, on recovering the throne of his ancestors.
Any person related within the ninth degree to the Chief
of the Clan Macduff, who committed manslaughter, was
entitled, when he fled to Macduff’s cross, in Fife, to
have his punishment remitted to a fine, or at least to
be repledged and exempted from trial in any other
jurisdiction, by the Earl of Fife. History records that
this privilege of sanctuary, saved the life of Hugh de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
Arbuthnot and his accomplices, from trial for the
murder of John de Melvil of Glenbervie, in the year
1421.</p>

<p>The Scotch law of sanctuary was more guarded than
the English, in the middle ages, in affording too easy
an immunity for crime, but in this country, there existed
in most recent times, a sanctuary for debtors in
the abbey and palace of Holyrood, with its precincts,
including the hill of Arthur’s Seat and the Queen’s
Park.<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The privilege of sanctuary, while it obtained in England
and Scotland gave rise to considerable legislation
and litigation, to restrain the right within the proper
limits and to interpret the laws governing the privilege
as it had previously been enjoyed.</p>

<p>In 1378 it was ordained that debtors claiming sanctuary
with the intent of defrauding their creditors
should have their goods and lands levied upon to discharge
their debts.<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>In 1487 Pope Innocent VIII. authorized the arrest of
persons who left the sanctuary, to commit murder, robbery
or other felony, though they sought the sanctuary,
the second time, for protection and he ordered at the
same time that those inmates of sanctuaries who were
guilty of treason should be prevented from leaving the
realm.<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span></p>

<p>Statutes of the time of Henry VIII. greatly curtailed
the privilege of sanctuary. By act of Parliament,
passed in the twenty-first year of his reign,<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> it was
provided that the culprit:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Immediately after his confession, and before his abjuration,
was to be branded by the coroner with a hot
iron upon the brawn of the thumb of the right hand,
with the sign of the letter A, to the intent he might be
the better known among the king’s subjects to have
abjured.”</p>

</div>

<p>It was found that the citizenship of the realm was
becoming weakened by sanctuary men <i>abjuring the
realm</i>, so Henry VIII., by statute provided,<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> That</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“every person abjuring was to repair to some sanctuary
within the reign which himself should choose, and
there remain during his natural life; and to be sworn
before the coroner upon his abjuration so to do. But
if he went out of that sanctuary, unless discharged by
the king’s pardon, and committed murder or felony, he
was liable to be brought to trial for that offense, and
was excluded from the right of sanctuary.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the twenty-sixth year of the reign of this monarch,
sanctuary was taken away where the crime was treason,<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
and in the thirty-second year of his reign it was
enacted that “all sanctuary persons were to wear a
badge or cognisance to be assigned and appointed by
the governour of every sanctuary, openly upon their
outer garment, of the compass, in length and breadth of
ten inches under the pain of forfeiting the privilege of
sanctuary.” They were also prevented from carrying
knives or swords or other weapons and were not to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
leave their lodging except between sunrise and sunset,
and the right of sanctuary was also confined, by Henry
VIII., to parish churches, churchyards, cathedrals, hospitals
and college churches and all dedicated chapels.</p>

<p>One of the first acts of James I., when he began to
rule over England, was to further abridge the right of
sanctuary and twenty years afterward in 1624, the
same monarch finally abolished the right of sanctuary
for all kinds of crime, in England.<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Various precincts continued to afford shelter for
criminals, in and about London, however, long after the
enactment of this statute of James I., intended to finally
abolish the practice and it was not until the later act
of 1697 that the custom was finally abrogated for good,
in England.<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Both while the practice of sanctuary obtained and
years after it passed away, however, the institution
furnished a theme for popular authors to weave
romances around and Shakespeare, Shadwell, Sir
Walter Scott, and other writers, whose names commence
with other letters of the alphabet, have found
the ancient law of sanctuary, an attractive source of
legal reference.</p>

<p>In describing the argument before the Council, as to
the right of Queen Elizabeth, the widow of Edward IV.
and her son, to claim sanctuary, when they had committed
no crimes and the son had done nothing to entitle
him to sanctuary, Shakespeare makes Buckingham
say, in Richard III.:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Buck.</i> ... You break not sanctuary in seizing him.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The benefit thereof is always granted</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Cardinal Wolsey sought the benefit of sanctuary,
after his disgrace, at the Abbey of Leicester, in King
Henry VIII., in the following touching plea:<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“O father Abbot, an old man, broken with the storms of State,
Is come to lay his weary bones among ye; Give him a little earth,
for charity.”</p>

</div>

<p>The poor, desolate widow of Edward IV., after the
death of her husband, whose plea of sanctuary we have
already described, is thus made to reflect upon the protection
in sanctuary, in 3’ Henry VI.:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Queen Elizab.</i> I’ll hence, forthwith, unto the sanctuary,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And in Coriolanus, as if realizing that sanctuary was
an institution that had out lived its usefulness, Shakespeare
thus refers to it as a “rotten privilege”; when
Aufidius is made to say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Auf.</i> ... nor sleep nor sanctuary, being naked, sick; nor fane nor capital;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The prayers of priests, nor times of sacrifice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their rotten privilege and custom ’gainst</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My hate to Marcius.”<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>Already the trend of public thought was against the
custom which afforded exemption to the criminal seeking
refuge in the sacred places of the kingdom, and the
ancient law of sanctuary, since the reign of Henry VII.
had been gradually amended and so many different
limitations were imposed upon the ancient privilege
during the reign of Henry VIII., that the public were
about ready for the final repeal of the law, by King
James, so the gifted Shakespeare, ever alive to the
popular views of his audiences, in referring to sanctuary,
in Coriolanus, speaks of it as a “rotten privilege”
that could not stay the hatred of Aufidius for Marcius.</p>

<p>This old institution has passed away forever, in the
ever flowing flood of time, carried away by the current
of the centuries. The necessity for such a custom has
long ceased to exist, but in the dim past, when the
“avenger of blood” was abroad in the land and men,
fed upon the delusions that were rampant, clamored,
like wolves, for the life blood of the criminal, the old
knockers on the sanctuary doors were most welcome
sights to the fearful criminal, pursued by the howling
mob. In our imagination we can see the cringing murderer,
bent and fearful, as he hurries through the black
browed night, followed by his blood-thirsty pursuers,
like a hunted stag, fleeing for the blessed portals of the
sacred places. What a sigh of relief he must have
felt, when he reached the ancient altar of some of the
old sanctuaries of the middle ages and with what exultation
his heart must have throbbed, as he clung to
the ancient “frith-stool” that for untold centuries had
afforded protection to criminals from the vengeance of
the pursuer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span></p>

<p>This obsolete custom of the inhabitants of the lost
world of the past had for its recommendation the charitable
and philanthropic object of saving men from the
many “crimes against criminals,” then obtaining.
Many instances, no doubt, existed, where the practice
was used to prevent the civil authorities from enforcing
the law and it was used as an instrument whereby
“crimes went unwhipt by justice.” But in the harsh
days when the extremes, in that regard, prevailed, it
is as well that Mercy was thus used to temper Justice,
and, upon the beneficent theory that “it is better for
a thousand guilty men to go free than for one innocent
man to suffer,” it was an institution accompanied with
most benevolent results.</p>

<p>The hands of the officers of the law were held up
when they came to the charmed portals of the sacred
sanctuary. The old Mosaic law and the time honored
charters of the Crown decreed it. And while the officer
was thus thwarted and Justice cheated, the “boys of
Westminster Knoll”; “the birds of St. Martin’s”; the
“Bravoes of Alsatia” and “Freemen of the Borough,”
flourished and lived. Many of them, perhaps, belonged
to the large class of the “predestined lost” and if their
inner lives had been scanned, there were no doubt
mitigating circumstances why they happened to be as
they were. It may have been decreed, from the beginning
that they should be criminals, instead of honest men.
However this may be, they contributed to the quota
of the crime of the world and with the right and wrong
then obtaining, have past away forever. Let us be
thankful that as many of them as did successfully embrace
the privileges of sanctuary were spared through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
this merciful custom, for, in the end, it will make no
difference whether this or that criminal suffered death
just at this or that particular time, or a little later.
He paid the penalty of the flesh certainly, without much
delay and that he was allowed to consort with holy men,
free from the war of the outside world, and feel the influence
of their altruism for a time, and listen to the
service of the sacred altar, with its superstitious chant,
could but have had a softening and leavening influence
upon his life.</p>

<p>So while inconsistent with a proper administration of
justice, which contemplates the visitation of equal
punishment upon all alike, under similar conditions,
for the same crimes, amid the rapine and murder of
the middle ages it was often a shield for innocence, as
well as a protection for crime and we can hardly regret
that there was such an oasis in the desert, where
the persecuted could find rest from the wild beasts of
the desert domains—“wilder than wildest wolf or
bear.” They all have gone, who suffered then—gone,
“with the snows of yesterday”—the way the Mammoth
went his way. So whether it was good or ill, since sanctuary
gave to those who lived and suffered here below,
“one little glimpse of Paradise, to ope the eyes and
ears of men,” we would not have it otherwise.</p>

Pollock and Maitland, in their excellent history of English Law,
say: “The coroner came and parleyed with the refugee, who had

If he chose the latter course, he hurried, dressed in pilgrim’s guise,
to the port that was assigned to him, and left England, being bound
by his oath, never to return. His lands escheated; his chattels
were forfeited, and if he ever came back, his fate was that of an
outlaw.” (Vol. II., p. 590.)</p>

Memorandum. That John Spret, of Barton, upon Umber, in the
counte of Lyncoln, com to Beverlay, the first day of October, the
vii year of the reen of Keing Henry the VII., and asked the lybertes
of Saint John of Beverlay, for the death of John Welton, husbondman
of the same town, and knawlig hymself to be at the kylling of

this tragedy, which resulted in the death of husbandman John
Welton, at the point of a dagger, in the hand of Mr. John Spret,
has caused both of these gentlemen to be known in history after
a period of many centuries, and this sad circumstance of their
lives is quoted long centuries later, to illustrate the manner of an
obsolete custom.</p>

were known during the period of Henry VII., as private sanctuaries,
while those that had not received special charters were called
general sanctuaries and in distinguishing the two, a historian of
that period has said:</p>

<p>“If a man fled to such a sanctuary as Westminster Knoll, he
might remain undisturbed for life; but if he chose to abjure within
the forty days, the coroner was to appoint him a day to do it.
The law of sanctuary is laid down in a reading of this period in
the following manner: None shall take sanctuary but <i>in periculo
vitae</i>, as for treason, felony, or the like and not for debt; for a grant
or prescription to have sanctuary for debt was against law and void.
But the reading lays down a strange quibble to evade this; for it
admits, that if a man’s body was in execution, and he escaped, and
came to a sanctuary, ordained as a refuge, and safeguard for a man’s
life, he should have benefit thereof, <i>because by long imprisonment his
life might be in jeopardy</i>. If a church was suspended for bloodshed,
he who took it for sanctuary should still enjoy it for forty days and
abjuration for felony, discharged all felonies done before the abjuration.
A man could not abjure for petit larceny, however, but
only for such felonies as induced the pain of death.” IV. Reeve’s
History English Law, p. 255.</p>

Surtees Society, gives the following description of the manner of
claiming sanctuary at Beverley and Durham:</p>

<p>“Persons who took refuge fled to the north door and knocked for
admission.... As soon as anyone was so admitted the galilee
bell was immediately tolled, to give notice that some one had taken
sanctuary. The offender was required, before the shrine of the
patron saint, and certain credible witnesses, to tell the nature of his
offense, and to toll a bell, in token of his demanding the privilege
of sanctuary.... Everyone who had the privilege of sanctuary
was provided with a black gown and a yellow cross, called St. Cuthbert’s
Cross, upon the left shoulder.... If one’s life was saved
the third time, by the privilege of sanctuary, he became permanently
a servant of the church.” Chamber’s Journal, Vol. 64, p. 514.</p>

<p>The debate at the Council Board, over the right to take refugees
from the sanctuary, occasioned by Queen Elizabeth’s refuge to
Westminster, is not without interest, in showing the views then
obtaining on this custom. It was contended that no right of sanctuary
existed, since no crime had been committed, as the right was
only extended to criminals, in fear of their lives; that the little
son had no right to sanctuary at all and that it was a flagrant abuse
of the privilege for the Queen to claim it. Those who advocated
roughly taking them away, were overcome by the mild persuasion
urged by the Archbishop of York, who counseled that the child be
obtained without force, if possible. See, Chamber’s Journal, Vol.
44, p. 171, Speed; Sir Thomas More.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br>
<span class="smcap">Ancient Punishments.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In the broader sense, punishment includes any pain
or detriment suffered in consequence of wrong-doing,
but as treated of in this chapter, it means the pain or
other penalty imposed by an authority to which the
offender is subject, for a crime or offense committed.</p>

<p>The term punishment is properly restricted to the
penalties imposed by competent authority, for violations
of law; but as the subject of the following pages
will bear evidence, it has been frequently imposed upon
the weak and the innocent, as well as upon the guilty,
and instead of being always confined to the authority
acting only in pursuance of the fixed rules of law, it
has too often resulted from the arbitrary will of someone
in superior authority.</p>

<p>“Man’s inhumanity to man” seems ever to have
been a peculiar trait of the species and human cruelty
exceeds that of all other animals, in the same proportion
that man excels the lower species. In following
the bent of his cruel impulses, man has never rect’ with
good or ill, but like a ravenous beast of prey, far
fiercer “than the wolf or bear, he slays his kind in
cruel glee and sorrows he can slay no more.”</p>

<p>When we read the history of the punishments of antiquity,
we can but wonder that the people suffered so
long and so continuously as a result of laws which had
for their foundation the passions or wickedness of only
a small per cent of the people, instead of the beneficent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
rules of conduct formulated by the “cool examiner of
human nature,” familiar with the actions of the multitude
and prompted by altruistic motives, to legislate
for the greatest happiness of the greater number.</p>

<p>Every just punishment should be limited to the necessity
of defending and preserving the liberty of the
masses of society from the usurpations and wrongs of
individuals, hence, every punishment which does not
arise from such necessity is tyranny.<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Since the time of Beccaria men have realized that the
groans of a tortured wretch cannot recall the time past,
or reverse the crime once committed,<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> so punishments
are now provided for, not to torment a sensible being,
nor to attempt to undo the crime committed, but to prevent
the criminal from doing further injury to society<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
and to deter others from committing similar offenses.
But it was not always thus. Torture, of the worst kind,
in the handling of criminals, has been consecrated as a
time honored custom by most of the older nations of
the world. Mankind, for centuries, seemed to forget
that all men were brothers; that a man, after he is dead
is good for nothing and since punishments were invented
for the good of society, that they ought to be
useful and not destructive, still they universally persecuted
each other, even to the death.</p>

<p>All mankind have ever detested the violence of which
they may themselves possibly be the victim, but the
criminal is so far regarded as an enemy to society, that
they universally desire the punishment inflicted upon
another which they would never want inflicted upon
themselves. Viewing all other men as inconsequential
in the sum total of the universe, but each individual
believing himself the center of the social unit, men
have been ever ready to play the tiger and make the
alleged criminal the lamb, because it was the other
individual whose life was sacrificed.</p>

<p>Viewing the whole plan of society by the standards
of the past, in the punishment of criminals, it is difficulty
to determine whether the crimes against society
or those of society against the alleged criminal, have
been the greater. But with the idea of reforming the
criminal, the barbarous tortures of the past have been
eliminated and the trend of modern criminologists is
to further limit all punishments, not in themselves
wholly reformatory in their nature.</p>

<p>Excessive punishments have always increased, rather
than diminished crime, yet authority to inflict punishment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
has never been much concerned about the welfare
of the race or of society, as a whole, and the humane
law of the philosophers has been disregarded far too
long to curb the ingenious cruelty that has inflicted
penalties and pains upon alleged criminals, frequently
wholly innocent of any crime.</p>

<p>The object of this chapter, however, is not to moralize
about crimes and punishments, but to contribute
something to the vast fund of historical information
upon the subject of ancient punishments, with a few
illustrations of the pains and penalties inflicted during
the past ages, in the name of law, upon the unfortunate
victims falling into the vortex of the current of a past
civilization and hopelessly borne on to their destruction.</p>

<p><i>Capital punishment, by beheading</i> was not practiced
by the ancient Israelites, but was a custom of the Egyptians,
Assyrians, Persians, Greeks and Romans,<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and
the French. We find that the “chief baker,” who incurred
Pharoah’s ill-will, was accordingly decapitated;<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
John the Baptist lost his head on the order of
Herod;<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> James the Apostle suffered a similar fate,<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
and many other of the early martyrs were beheaded.<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><i>Burning</i> to death was of pre-Mosaic authority, for
we find that when it was reported to Judah that his
daughter-in-law Tamar, was with child and had played
the harlot, Judah said, “Bring her forth and let her be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
burnt.”<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This was the punishment inflicted upon a
priest’s daughter, under the Sinaitic law, for fornication,<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
and was also the form of punishment for incest
with a wife’s mother.<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><i>Drowning</i> was a form of capital punishment in vogue
among the ancient Babylonians, the Jews and the Romans
and more recently among the French, English
and Americans, during the witch craze in the seventeenth
century.<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Even before the witch craze, in England, in which
death by burning and drowning was the usual mode of
ending the lives of the poor unfortunates, accused of
this hated and unprovable crime, there were precedents
for the use of drowning, as a punishment, in that
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<p>During the reign of Edward II. felons were put to
death by drowning, for we find that in the sixth year
of the reign of that monarch, the jury for the hundred
of Cornylo, in Kent, exhibited a presentment to Hervi
de Stanton, and his associate justices itinerant, sitting
at Canterbury, in the Octaves of St. John the Baptist,
importing, that the Prior of the Christ-church in Canterbury,
did, about eleven years then past, divert the
course of a certain stream, called Cestling, in which
such felons as were condemned, to death, within the
before-mentioned hundred, ought to suffer judgment
by drowning.<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Drowning was regarded as an especially appropriate
punishment for women in Scotland, at an early day and
according to Dr. Hill Burton, in 1624, eleven gipsy
women were sentenced to be drowned in the North
Loch, of Edinburgh, in the hollow where the Princess
street Garden is now located.<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In 1685 two women, Margaret M’Lauchlan, a widow,
and Margaret Wilson, a young girl, of eighteen, were
drowned at Wigtownshire, for their religious belief.
They were bound to stakes where the swift tide of the
Solway overflows twice a day. After a partial unconsciousness,
the young girl was revived and was urged
by her friends to say “God save the King.” She refused
and as the waters closed over her for the last
time, she gasped: “I am Christ’s.” And thus she
gained a place in history, as a martyr to her belief,
and her young life was forfeited as a penalty for having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
incurred the religious and political bigotry of a
despotic monarch.<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><i>Exposure to wild beasts</i>, was a common punishment
of the Israelites, and Romans, for wickedness or unfaithfulness.
Darius caused Daniel to be brought and
cast into the den of lions,<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> for this was the law of the
Persians, and the King had entered a decree that it
should be so, and another ancient authority,<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> advises
us that a disobedient prophet, named Jadon, met death
from God, by being cast before the lions.</p>

<p><i>Hanging</i> is one of the forms of capital punishment
that has survived for thousands of years, for we find
that it was in general use among the ancient patriarchs,<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
the Persians<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and the Greeks<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and has continued
as a mode of capital punishment ever since, in
other civilized, or rated civilized, countries.<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><i>Precipitation, sawing asunder, slaying by spear or
sword, stoning to death, strangling and suffocation</i>,
were all different modes of inflicting the death penalty,
practiced among the ancient Israelites and other ancient
peoples, from the earliest time.</p>

<p>The children of Judah cast 10,000 Edomites from a
rock to their death, according to the second book of
Chronicles;<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> even the valiant David, painful to relate,
when he took the cities of the children of Ammon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
brought forth all the people and “cut them with saws,
and with harrows of iron, and with axes”;<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> the spear,
javelin or dart, was to be used on trespassers, at the
foot of Sinai;<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> the sword was taken by the Levites
against the worshipers of the golden-calf;<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Samuel
hewed Agag to pieces with the sword;<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> stoning to
death was the penalty for adultery, blasphemy, idolatry,
for false prophesy and Sabbath breaking;<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> strangling
was the proposed punishment for the Syrians, before
Israel<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and suffocation was used both by the ancient
Jews and the Macedonians.<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><i>Crucifixion</i>, was a refined mode of punishment used
by the Jews and Romans, in the time of the Saviour.
It was borrowed by the Romans and Grecians from the
Phoenicians, Persians, Egyptians and Numidians,
among whom it was in general vogue. Alexander is
reported to have crucified two thousand Tyrians at one
time, and the same number of rioters were crucified
by Varos at one time, after the death of Herod.<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Under Claudius and Nero, various Roman governors
crucified large numbers of robbers, thieves, and
political and religious criminals.<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>The method of crucifixion is accurately described in
the New Testament.<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>After conviction, the victim was scourged with the
<i>flagellum</i>, which was such a severe punishment that the
afflicted one frequently died before the crucifixion occurred.
In Jesus’ case, the scourging seems to have
taken place before the crucifixion, as was the custom.</p>

<p>The cross-bar was bound upon the back of the victim,
or his head was placed in the <i>patibulum</i>, and he was
then led through the city, accompanied by the centurions
and soldiers having his execution in hand,
amid the gibes and insults of the cruel crowd. The
title, a piece of wood, covered with white gipsum,
labeled with the crime for which he was to suffer, in
letters of black, was usually carried before the condemned
person, so that the curious might be advised
of the cause of his death.</p>

<p>At the place of crucifixion, the prisoner was stripped
and his clothes given to the soldiers; he was then
bound to the <i>patibulum</i> and thus raised on ladders,
until the notch was reached in the upright piece, to
receive it, or the cross-piece was fastened to the upright
post upon the ground and then raised into an
upright position, with the afflicted one bound to the
cross, with his hands nailed to the ends, there to suffer
the slow agonies of a lingering death, which might last
for hours or perhaps for days.</p>

<p>The shame of this torture to which the Saviour was
subjected has become not only the symbol of salvation,
but the true type of that absolute renunciation of the
world which characterizes the true Christian, for did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
not Christ Himself say: “If any man would come after
me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and
follow me”?<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><i>Burying alive</i>, was a form of capital punishment
applied in Rome as a punishment to the vestal virgins,
violating their oaths of chastity and it was also in
vogue in France during the middle ages.</p>

<p>According to the law of Numa, the unchaste Vestal
was simply stoned to death,<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> but the cruel torture of
burying her alive was devised by Tarquinius Priscus
and inflicted from his time forward.<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>On her conviction, the poor creature was stripped
of her <i>vittae</i> and other indicia of office and after being
scourged, was attired like a corpse and placed in a
closed litter, and then borne through the Forum, attended
by her weeping relatives and friends, with all
the ceremonies of a real funeral, to the <i>Campus Sceleratus</i>,
within the walls of the city, near the Colline gate.
The vault, underground, was furnished with a couch,
a lamp, and a table, with a little food. The pontifex
maximus offered up a prayer to Heaven for the culprit
and having thus performed his sacred office, delivered
her to the executioner, who led her down into the subterranean
cell and drew up the ladder and filled the pit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
with earth even with the ground,<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> thus forever consigning
to mother earth the body of her wayward
daughter, who, in pursuance of her God-given instincts,
had violated the unnatural law of the barbarous pagan
days of ancient Rome.</p>

<p>The gallant French gentlemen also reserved this
horrible punishment for women and we read that during
the year 1302 by order of the Bailli of Sainte-Genevieve,
a woman was buried alive for some petty thefts
which she had committed.<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Philip Augustus is said
to have put a French provost to death in this cruel
fashion, because of the crime of perjury, regarding
a transaction in connection with a vineyard<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and in
the thirteenth century in Bigorre, this punishment was
inflicted for murder, the murdered and his murderer
being interred in the same grave.<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> One performing
the unnatural crime was also buried alive, in England,
at an early day, according to Fleta.<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p><i>Drawing and quartering</i>, is of Egyptian and Roman
origin, for we find that it existed at Rome five hundred
years before Christ and is mentioned in the Twelve
Tables.<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Hanging, drawing and quartering is said to have
been first introduced in England in the case of William<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
Maurice, a pirate, in 1241,<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> although it afterwards became
quite common, as a punishment for treason.</p>

<p>According to the terms of a sentence imposed by
Lord Ellenborough, the criminal convicted of treason
to be thus punished was addressed as follows: “You
are to be drawn on hurdles to the place of execution,
where you are to be hanged, but not until you are dead;
for, while still living, your body is to be taken down,
your bowels torn out and burnt before your face;
your head is then to be cut off and your body divided
into four quarters.”<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Hugh Spenser, the favorite of King Edward II., was
put to death at Bristol, in 1326, and his body was quartered,
as was the custom of the period, in similar cases,
and his head was sent to London, while each quarter
of his body was sent to each of the four principal towns
of the kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>On the execution of the Jesuit, Garnet, in England,
in 1606, James I., who was more compassionate in this
case than he was in the cases of witchcraft, where no
punishment could be found too severe, gave orders
that he should not be cut down until he was dead, so
that he might be spared the tortures of drawing and
quartering.<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> But no such mercy was shown to Guy
Fawkes, who was tortured and drawn and quartered,
the same year, after he was taken with the burning
match in his hand, in his attempt to blow up the king
and his parliament, in what was known as the gunpowder
plot.<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span></p>

<p>During the thirteenth century, in England, the usual
punishment for petty treason was hanging and drawing
for a man and burning for a woman.<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p><i>Boiling in oil</i> during the reign of Henry VIII.,<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> was
a punishment provided for poisoners.</p>

<p>Under the reign of this monarch, the power of the
Crown was extended to cover powers not before recognized
and while it is difficult to concede how citizens
reared under the broad influence of the common law,
could be brought to consent to such unusual and cruel
punishment for any crime, the inhuman crime which
brought about this harsh statute was such as to call
for unusual handling, if not for such barbarous punishment
as this act provided.</p>

<p>One Richard Roose had placed poison in a vessel
of yeast in the Bishop of Rochester’s kitchen and as
a result of eating bread in which this yeast was used,
seventeen persons in the family of the Bishop and
others of his friends were poisoned. The enormity of
the crime caused wide-spread indignation and such
crimes were made treason and the offender subject
to attainder. Roose was ordered to be boiled to death
and in order to deter others similarly situated from
perpetrating such a cruel crime, it was also provided
by the act that henceforth, every wilful murder by
poisoning, should be high treason and that all such
offenders should be boiled to death.<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Shakespeare makes the indignant Paulina, refer to
this statute, in her reproachful speech to the Lords,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
after the good Hermione’s incarceration, in Winter’s
Tale, when she asks:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Margaret Davy, a young woman, convicted of murder
by poisoning was also boiled to death, as provided
by this statute, in 1542,<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> but this was the last victim
to suffer such inhuman punishment and the act was
soon afterward repealed.</p>

<p>The misguided efforts of the Church of Rome to
punish heresy by use of the <i>Inquisition</i>, brought about
untold suffering and misery in the world.</p>

<p><i>The Inquisition</i>, was a tribunal of the Roman Catholic
Church, for the discovery, repression, and punishment
of heresy, unbelief and other offenses against
religion. The emperors, Theodosius and Justinian, appointed
officials known as Inquisitors, to look out and
punish such offenders. They proceeded however in the
name of the Emperors, in the secular courts, and no
regular tribunal for the handling of this kind of alleged
criminals, existed until the year 1248, after the
fourth Lateran Council, held in the reign of Innocent
III., when Innocent IV., established a permanent court
for the prosecution and punishment of this class of
offenders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span></p>

<p>The prosecutions under this constitution were purely
in the ecclesiastical courts, and for the next century,
in France, Italy, Spain and Germany, the Pope, by
appeal, regulated the severity of the punishments inflicted
by the local authorities and the punishments
were not so severe as they afterwards became.</p>

<p>In Spain, during the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella,
on account of an alleged plot to overthrow the monarchy,
by the Jews and Heretics, in the year 1478, on
application to Pope Sixtus IV., they were permitted to
take over, as it were, the whole tribunal formerly
handled as a Church affair, into the hands of the State,
and with this new regime, the Spanish Inquisition had
its origin.</p>

<p>Inquisitors were now appointed by the Crown,
instead of the Church and under the career of Thomas
de Torquemada, in 1483, the reign of terror commenced
in Spain. Llorente, the historian of the Inquisition,
places the number of persons burned to death, during
Torquemada’s tenure of office, in sixteen years, in
Spain, at 9,000, and during the term of office of the
second head of the Inquisition, Diego Deza, in eight
years, 1,600 met a similar death, by fire, as this was
the customary punishment inflicted upon this hated
class of innocents who opposed the ruling powers in
Church and State.<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The procedure of the Inquisition is not without interest.
The person suspected of heresy or unbelief,
was arrested and thrown into prison, to be brought to
trial when it suited the pleasure of his judges. The proceedings
of the trial when the unfortunate one was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
brought into court, were secret; he was not faced with
his accusers, nor were their names disclosed. The evidence
of a guilty accomplice, without corroboration,
was received against the accused and the person undergoing
trial was liable to be put to torture, in order to
extort a confession from him. When convicted, the
punishment was death by fire, or on the scaffold, imprisonment
in the galleys for life, or for a term of
years, with forfeiture of his property, and civil infamy,
if the offense was deemed not of sufficient gravity to
justify burning to death.<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>After confession, under torture, the prisoner was
customarily remanded to prison and when brought
before the judge, if he persisted in his profession, he
was condemned. If the confession was withdrawn, he
was tortured again and if he recanted a second time,
he was tortured a third time, for while the theory was
that he could not be convicted, unless he let his confession
stand, he was tortured until he confessed and
was not allowed to voluntarily retract it, oftentimes.<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Three judges were necessary to approve the infliction
of torture to extract evidence from a person accused,
in the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella,<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> but this law
was often violated and the strappado, the scourge,
hanging the accused by the arms, while his back and
legs were loaded with heavy weights, fire, applied to
the soles of the feet and pouring water down the throat
were a few of the many tortures applied<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> to extort
confessions from the poor unfortunates who fell into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
the hands of these religious zealots, imbued with a
superhuman inclination to torture their fellow-men.</p>

<p>Of course the subject of the Inquisition is too large
a field to attempt to do more than refer to its influence
upon secular law in these pages, for while it continued
unabated for centuries in countries subject to the
Church of Rome and was not abolished in Spain, until
the reign of Joseph Bonaparte in 1808,<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> in inaugurating
a system of punishment for extracting evidence
from the accused, its influence was wide-spread in all
other countries, where the same system of punishment
was carried and with time the same vile procedure was
used in most other countries of Europe, in one form or
another,<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and with its examples of torture, which were
gradually adopted in other countries, the equally baleful
influence of the secret procedure, which was exemplified
in the Star Chamber in England and the <i>Chatelet</i>
of Paris, with the accompanying inquisitorial process,
followed in the wake of this hateful institution of the
middle ages.<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p><i>The Grand Chatelet of Paris</i>, as the seat of the criminal
tribunal of the realm, has a record second to no
other criminal court of the same age for atrocious
punishments inflicted upon the poor unfortunates who
were brought before the court, seeking justice.<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>It was the custom to torture all malefactors, or alleged
criminals, brought before the criminal division
of the <i>Chatelet</i> of Paris, in the fourteenth century. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
customary procedure was accordingly divided into two
classes of cases, those known as <i>ordinaire</i> and those
called <i>extraordinaire</i>. In the former class of cases inquests
were held to determine the guilt of the accused
and in the latter inquisition was had, in which torture
was habitually employed to secure a conviction.<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The procedure was left entirely to the discretion of
the criminal judge and in a short time the judge rarely
found a case for inquest, but all cases were treated as
within the rule <i>proces extraordinaire</i> and a merry
chronicle of crime against criminals was here inaugurated,
for long and tedious years.<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The only redeeming feature of the procedure of
this court, was the universality of its punishments, for
noble blood was made to flow equally with the plebeian,
and none were exempt from the torture, who were
brought before this court. If the culprit denied the
alleged crime, he was tortured at once, to secure a confession
and if he confessed he was tortured for confessing.
On the other hand, if he failed to confess,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
there was no limit to the torture inflicted to extract
a confession from him, so frequently it happened that
in the effort to find out if a crime were really committed
the poor unfortunate was killed by the torture to which
he was subjected.<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>In 1338 one Jehannin Maci, was arrested and brought
before this cruel court for stealing a brass pot, found
in his possession. After torture, he confessed the crime
and was drawn on a hurdle and hanged.<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Gervaise Caussois—peace to his ashes—was brought
before this august tribunal for stealing some iron tools
and to induce him to confess he was tortured and
promptly confessed. Thinking he might be guilty of
other offenses, he was tortured again and then under
the strain of the pain he suffered, he confessed to other
petty crimes, when he was again tortured by use of
the <i>tresteau</i>, when he again confessed to another petty
misdemeanor when the judges mercifully caused him
to be hanged, without more ado, thus ending his
misery.<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>In 1390 poor Fleurant de Saint-Leu, was arraigned
before this heartless tribunal for the awful crime of
stealing a silver buckle. He denied the crime and was
twice tortured, with increasing severity, when he
finally confessed, but protested that it was his first
offense. The merciful judges, out of the goodness of
their hearts, decided this offense, being the first, did
not merit death, so on the same day he was tortured
thrice, to ascertain if he was not guilty of some other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
offense for which he could be killed; this failing to
bring the desired result, he was again twice tortured,
when he admitted that three years before he had unwittingly
married a prostitute, when he was afterwards
hanged, as this was found to be a sufficient offense, together
with the stealing of the buckle, to justify the
death penalty.<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Poor Marguerite de la Penele, accused of stealing a
ring, was tortured until she confessed and as she could
not satisfy the human hyenas who were trying her, for
some money found upon her person, she was again
severely tortured and although no further confession
was extracted from her she was buried alive.<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The question <i>ordinaire</i> and <i>extra-ordinaire</i>, as put
to the wretches brought before this criminal court at
Paris, was to be answered by the accused while fastened
to the wall, on a trestle or sliding table, with his
wrists fastened in two rings; his mouth was forced
open with a horn and water was poured down his throat,
until he answered the question whether or not he was
guilty of the offense charged against him.<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Another form of torture used in the <i>Chatelet</i> at
Paris, was what was called the “boots,” being solid
boards, pierced with holes, encasing the legs, up to the
knees. Ropes were inserted through the holes and
drawn so tight, by means by pegs of wood, driven into
the holes, as to almost break the bones and twist the
flesh off the legs, if the accused persisted in refusing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
to confess the crime charged against him.<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> This horrible
and barbarous practice was not completely abolished
in France, until the year 1788, when the monarchy
repealed the law authorizing such cruelty, for the alleged
reason that under such stress of punishment
men would confess to anything.<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p><i>The Guillotine</i> was not a French invention, as generally
supposed, but was imported from Italy, where
a similar instrument, known as the <i>Mannaya</i>, had been
used for centuries before it was used either in France
or England.<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> It had been used in England long before
it was used in France and was known as the <i>Halifax
Maiden</i>, because of the special charter, giving this
town a right to use it for petty larceny of any article
exceeding thirteen halfpenny.<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> It was used in France
in the sixteenth century and at Toulouse, in 1632, it
was the engine which accomplished the execution of
the Duc de Montmorency.<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Doctor Joseph Guillotin
brought the same engine of death before the National
Assembly, in December, 1789 and he is generally recognized
as the inventor of this terrible machine, which
was used to decapitate so many of the nobility during
the terrible French Revolution,<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> but a similar instrument
had executed thousands in Italy centuries before
it was known or used in France.<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p><i>The Massola</i> was used in Italy, at an early date,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
along with the <i>Mannaya</i> or guillotine, as it was afterwards
called, in France, and by use of the former
machine, the criminal was stunned with a blow from
a mace, much as the butcher slaughters the ox or hog
by striking him on the head and then while stunned,
his throat was pierced with a long knife and his chest
was ripped open.<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>But let us turn from the contemplation of other instruments
used to accomplish the death of the criminals
of the middle ages, and examine some of the milder
forms of punishments in vogue.</p>

<p>These were only some of the most prominent methods
of inflicting capital punishment upon alleged criminals,
among the old Israelites, Persians, Greeks and Romans,
and other lesser punishments, such as mutilation consisting
in blinding,<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> cutting off the hands or ears,<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
branding,<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> plucking off the hair,<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
    flaying,<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> scourging
with thorns,<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> the stocks, stripes,<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> the wheel, the rack,
the comb with sharp teeth, the burning tile, the low
vault in which the culprit was bent double, the heavy
hog-skin whip, and the injection of vinegar into the
nostrils, were a few of the lesser punishments inflicted
by these and other peoples for many long and tortuous
years, upon all classes of criminals and accused persons.<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<p><i>Blinding</i>, under the Mosaic dispensation, was claimed
to have been authorized under the law of retaliation,
“an eye for an eye,”<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> etc., but it was seldom used
among the patriarchs in old Israel.</p>

<p>The Assyrians and Babylonians used this means of
torturing the criminals convicted of rebellion or revolt,
in order to prevent them from doing further harm and
to furnish an example to others of the enormity of the
punishment for such an offense against the government.<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
We read in the book of Esther that such criminals
were not permitted to look upon the king,<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and
in Persia this method of punishment was inflicted for
rascality, thieving and rebellion.<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>According to the Code of Hammurabi, adopted some
2,500 years before Christ’s time, a surgeon of Babylon
who performed an unsuccessful operation, lost the hand
that operated upon the patient and for other offenses,
mutilation and blindness was provided for by this
ancient code of laws.<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>William the Conqueror prohibited his nobles from
inflicting the death penalty upon criminals who formerly
suffered death by hanging, but in lieu of this
more humane punishment, he authorized that criminals
convicted of certain felonies should be blinded, by
having their eyes pulled out; they were subjected to
castration and to mutilation, by having their <i>hands and
feet cut off</i>, according to the greatness of the offense,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
to the end that they might live and furnish a horrible
example to others committing such crimes.<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>According to Wigorn, in his annals, certain Welchmen,
convicted of treason, in the eleventh century, had
all these several kinds of punishment inflicted upon
them.<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Fox, in his work on Martyrology, reports a miracle
in the case of Elivard, of Weston Regis, in Bedfordshire,
who, being convicted of stealing a pair of hedging
gloves and a whetstone, in the reign of Henry II.,
lost his eyes and genitals, and through his devout
prayers, at the shrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury,
they were restored to him again.<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>This punishment by blinding and mutilation continued
but a short time, in England, however, for King
Henry I., in the year 1108, in the ninth year of his
reign repealed this law and provided hanging for felons
convicted of theft or robbery,<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> who had formerly been
subject to the punishment of blinding or mutilation,
by this harsh law of William the Conqueror.</p>

<p>In Switzerland, at an early day, blasphemers were
subject to having their <i>lips and tongue cut off</i><a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and
under the custom of Avignon, in 1243, a perjurer was
liable to punishment by having his lips and nose removed.<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p><i>Cutting off the ears</i> was a punishment inflicted upon
religious and political criminals in England, as late as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
the seventeenth century and the notable case of Bastwick,
Burton and Prynne, who had their ears removed
all at one time, in the Palace Yard, in London, in the
year 1637, illustrates the barbarous cruelty then obtaining
as to this class of criminals.</p>

<p>The prisoners were all favorites with the crowd, who
strewed flowers and nose-gays around them, at the
place of execution. The sheriff commenced with Burton,
who was an especial favorite with the by-standers
and when he removed each ear the people wept and
groaned and roared as if each one in the assembly had
his own ears removed. Bastwick loaned his own knife to
the officer and made use of his professional information
to advise him just how to remove his ears, so as to injure
him the least and asked him to lop them close, that
it might not be necessary for him “to come there
again.” Prynne had had his ears roughly cropped off
three years before and when the officer again attempted
to remove what remained, it gave him great pain, but
the stern old Puritan endured it without a groan, such
was the religious zeal with which they were all three
sustained in this act of martyrdom. After the fearful
ordeal was completed they were all three returned by
the officer to the prison,<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and thus ended another fearful
example of misguided authority and religious
bigotry, in thus pillorying and torturing three patriotic
citizens who violated no law and who had committed
no other offense than to speak plainly and then dared
to refuse to bow the knee to an authority they did not
recognize.</p>

<p><i>Branding with a hot iron</i>, was a punishment inflicted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
by the Persians, upon the class of criminals who were
deported, in order that they could subsequently be
identified and to furnish an example to others of the
fact that they had paid the penalty of the law as a
result of their misdeed.<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> In Biblical days, when burning
was inflicted as a punishment for adultery or fornication,
branding on the forehead was also used, as a
mark of shame.<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Slaves were sometimes branded on
the hand, by the ancient Jews,<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> much as horses are
branded by the owner, in the western country, to identify
the animal, but this was not in accordance with the
Mosaic law, for such disfigurement was forbidden by
the code of the old Israelites.<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Formerly, in England, branding was used in the case
of all clergyable crimes, by burning in the hand, but
this law was repealed in 1829. In the middle ages, in
England, branding with a hot iron, was a mode of
punishment used for various offenses. The iron used
had the form which it was desired to leave on the culprit’s
skin. It has not been in use for years, except in
desertions from the army or navy, and this form of
branding is regulated by statute and of late years ink,
or other material is used, instead of a hot iron. By
the Mutiny Act, of 1858,<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> it was provided “On the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
first and on every subsequent conviction, for desertion,
the court-martial, in addition to any other punishment,
may order the offender to be marked, on the left side,
two inches below the arm-pit, with the letter D, such
letter not to be less than an inch long, and to be marked
upon the skin with some ink or gun-powder, or other
preparation, so as to be visible and conspicuous, and
not liable to be obliterated.” This, in old England, as
late as the Victorian age, shows the early training of the
English upon the custom of punishment by branding.</p>

<p><i>Plucking off the hair</i>, or scalping, was not always
confined to the American Indians, but according to the
inspired word of the Jews, it was a form of punishment,
in ancient Israel, inflicted upon Jews who had indulged
in mixed marriages.<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>According to the prophet, in Isaiah, scalping, as a
judicial practice was common in his time, for he says:
“I gave my back to the smiters and my cheeks to them
that <i>plucked off the hair</i>: I hid not my face from shame
and spitting.”<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>And according to the Biblical account of this ancient
and severe punishment, inflicted upon criminals in old
Israel, they were not as compassionate as the American
Indians, who first killed their man, then removed the
scalp with a knife, but they tore off the hair in such
a brutal and barbarous manner, as to remove the skin
by main force, with the hair, without the use of a knife<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
or other instrument to augment or ameliorate the suffering
of the criminal.<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p><i>Flaying</i>, was a punishment in vogue among the Persians
and Assyrians, and according to Rawlinson, the
Assyrians would flay the victim, even after life was
extinct<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and the Persians were accustomed to flay
and then crucify the criminals and Herodotus states
that they used the skins of human beings thus obtained.<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Along with this atrocious punishment of flaying, the
Persians also seem to have been addicted to the recall
of judges,<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> for Herodotus tells how King Cambyses
not only recalled an unpopular judge, known as Sisamnes
but actually flayed him alive, and covered the
judgment-seat with his skin, as a warning to the next
judge to be more careful in his judgments and decrees.<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Manes is said to have been flayed alive, by Behram,
king of Persia, in the year 277 and his skin was afterwards
stuffed with straw, much as modern taxidermists
stuff the skins of wild animals, and in this shape it
was posted at one of the gates of Djondischaour.<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>In the sixth century Chosroes punished Nacoragan,
one of his generals by flaying him alive, on account of
his cowardice and his skin, when torn backward off his
body, from his head to his heels, retained the form of
the limbs, from which it had been stripped, and in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
manner, it was sown up and inflated and exposed on a
high projection, as a terrible example to other soldiers,
of the punishment they would be subjected to if also
guilty of cowardice in the discharge of their duty as
soldiers.<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Flaying is of rare appearance in Europe, but one or
two cases are recorded. Philip the Fair is said to have
inflicted such punishment upon the lovers of his sister-in-law,
in 1314, and Pope John XXII., after the conviction
of Hugues Geraldi, Bishop of Cahors, in 1317, for
sorcery, handed him over to the Judge of Avignon, who
caused him to be flayed alive and then torn asunder by
four horses, after which his remains were burnt.<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p><i>The Wheel</i> was used as a method of punishment in
France and England and other countries, during the
middle ages and down to a comparatively recent period.
St. Catherine, of Alexandria is said to have been put
to death on a wheel, with jagged edges or spikes, which
tore and cut her tender limbs, after the fashion of a
modern chaff-cutter. According to the report of her
case, the wheel was shattered, during the torture, by
Divine Grace, hence the embroidered tunic worn by the
Knights of Mount Sinai, a religious order, instituted in
her honour, in 1063, representing a broken wheel, with
spikes.<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Bouchard, who was implicated in the murder of
Charles le Bon, Count of Flanders, in the twelfth century,
was bound to a wheel suspended in mid-air, so
that the vultures could pluck out his eyes and otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
torture him. After his eyes were torn from their sockets
and his face slit and torn by the sharp beaks of the birds
of prey, he was finally put out of his misery, by darts
and javelins, shot into his quivering body, by the blood-thirsty
mob below.<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p><i>Scourging with thorns</i>, was another form of punishment
inflicted upon the peoples of other tribes, by the
good old Jewish patriarchs.</p>

<p>Gideon threatened that when the Lord of Israel
should deliver Zebah and Zalmunna into his hands
that he would tear their flesh with the thorns of the
wilderness and with briars.<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> And according to the
Divine word, when the men of Succoth were delivered
into his hand he took the elders of the city and with
briars and thorns, he scourged them.<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Knotted sticks, or ropes, with thorns, or iron points
were customarily used as instruments of chastisement
by the Jews, when they were successful in subjugating
another race of people<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and they did not hesitate to
apply the scourge on all occasions, as they regarded
this as a method of teaching foreign nations their
strength and their power to punish, so that it would
be advertised abroad and cause other timorous nations
to voluntarily submit to their authority.</p>

<p>David smote the Moabites with a line and cast them
down to the ground and he scourged them and they
became his servants and brought him gifts, to avoid
being further scourged in this manner.<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> And he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
brought the children of Ammon out from the cities
and not only scourged them with thorns and knotted
sticks, with iron pikes in the sticks, but subjected them
to saws and arrows of iron and made them to pass
through the brick kiln.<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p><i>The Bilboes</i>, were used in Spain and England, at an
early day, for slanderers and other petty offenders.
By means of this instrument, the culprit was held with
his feet aloft, on his back, exposed to the public gaze
and ridicule of the passers-by.</p>

<p>The American Colonists made frequent use of this
instrument of punishment and we read that in good
old Massachusetts, in August, 1632, one “James Woodward
was sett in the bilbowes, for being drunk at the
Newetowne,” the name Cambridge then went by.<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p><i>The Ducking-stool</i>, a stool or seat, arranged at the
end of a rope tied to a long pole, so it could be lowered
into the water, was used as a punishment for “scolds”
and “slanderers” in old England and by the early
American Colonies. Virginia, Maryland and other of
the American Colonies, provided for the use of the
ducking-stool and other similar correctionary punishments,
by statutes.<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>As late as the year 1811, in Georgia, one Miss Palmer
was sentenced to be ducked, as a scold or slanderer, in
the Oconee River<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and in Washington, according to
the interesting book on “Curious Punishments of By-Gone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
Days,” by Alice Morse Earle, almost in our own
day, Mrs. Anne Royal, Editor of the “Washington
Paul Pry,” was sentenced before Judge William
Cranch to suffer punishment by being ducked in the
Potomac River.<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p><i>The Stocks</i> graced each parish, in England, at an
early day and along with the <i>pillory</i> and the <i>rack</i>, were
used on different classes of petty criminals. Many
criminals were also punished by the American Colonists
by use of the stocks and the pillory, and in Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, Virginia and Maryland,
the manners and morals of many an early patriot were
mended by the use of these instruments.<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p><i>The Rack</i> was a wooden framework, in which the culprit
was fastened and by means of ropes and pulleys
his arms and legs were violently stretched and pulled
until the tension caused the most intense pain and frequently
the bones were broken by the use of this fearful
appliance. According to Lord Coke, the appliance was
first introduced into the Tower, in England, by the
Duke of Exeter, in 1467, and for this reason it was
called, “The Duke of Exeter’s Daughter.” The Tower
rack was in the long vaulted dungeon below the
Armoury and continued as an instrument of torture
for many centuries. During the reign of Elizabeth, it
was a customary means of torture and in 1580 the
Jesuit Priests concerned in the alleged Jesuit Invasion,
were terribly racked to compel them to disclose the
names of their leaders.<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span></p>

<p>Shakespeare makes frequent references to this instrument
of torture, so generally used during his time,
in England. Thus, in Merchant of Venice, Portia refers
to the enforced statements of Bassanio:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ay, but I fear, you speak upon the rack,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where men enforced do speak anything.”<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Brank</i>, known as the “Scold’s bridle,” was an
iron hood, with a ring, around the face, with a flat
tongue of iron to be placed in the mouth, over the
tongue. It was applied, with the “scold” or slanderer
tied in a public place, where she was subjected to the
ridicule of the passers-by and was generally used to
correct scolds and fussy women, for many years, in
both England and America. It was used on the poor
unfortunates during the Salem Witchcraft craze and
many an old dame in good old England was made to
bridle her tongue and desist from gossiping or henpecking
her husband, because of the fear of the “scold’s
bridle” and the gag, used indiscriminately, in all such
cases.<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Fortunately, with the dawn of better days, this torture
system began to decline and in most civilized
countries, such “crimes against criminals” are now but
curious and quaint, yet oft-times terrible and fearful
examples of the customs and procedure of other days.</p>

<p>The strange thing is that such things lasted as long
as they did in a growing, increasing world of knowledge,
with men who sought the truth and attempted to
attain the higher ideals and who should have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
imbued with the love of their fellow-man, which the
sufferings and mistakes of the past had, for centuries,
led them to emulate.</p>

<p>With the striking example in history of the horrible
punishment by Crucifixion, all men now dread to think
of the time when innocence and goodness could be so
crucified, yet for two thousand years, in the slow evolution
of the human race, other innocents and good men
and women have been tortured and racked by men and
women holding the superior power and authority over
the masses, who through superstition and delusion,
were led to endorse the cruel domination of such misused
force.</p>

<p>When we stop and contemplate the enormity of
“Man’s inhumanity to man,” as recorded in the lessons
of the past, “the marvel is that man can smile, dreaming
his ghostly, ghastly dream.”</p>

<p>The basis of such misanthropy lies in the fact that
criminals have been treated as enemies, to such an extent
that mankind has warred upon them and committed
deeds of war, when, in point of fact, the alleged
criminal, frequently was less guilty than his judges,
and, if guilty, he was only a mistaken man, needing correction,
but not torture or death, to teach him the better
path to tread. Would that future generations might
be fully emancipated from the selfish creed which calls
that good, which works <i>me</i> weal and holds that ill, which
<i>me</i> alone doth harm or hurt.</p>

<p>For our lives, like ravelled skeins, cross back and
forth, connect and blend,</p>

<p>The three theories regarding lawful punishment, are, retribution,
prevention and reformation. According to the first of these theories,
the object of punishment is the vindication of the law upon the
offender, by the infliction of such pain or penalty as his crime
deserves, hence, the motto for this theory, might be properly said
to be Justice. The second idea, makes prevention of further crime,
the sole object, the criminal being placed where he can do no
further wrong to society, and the motto of this school of legal
philosophers, can therefore properly be said to be protection. The
third and by far the most philanthropic doctrine of punishment
regards the object of correction as the primary one to be attained
and that all punishment should cease when the criminal has been
reformed. The motto for the last school of philosophy, might
properly be said to be Brotherly Love.</p>

<p>In France, death by drowning was inflicted upon the incontinent,

<p>Ninety priests were loaded into the <i>gabare</i> and sunk in the river
Seine. Then a hundred and thirty-eight persons were similarly
drowned, but the <i>gabare</i> was soon done away with and men, women
and children were stripped naked and thrown into the river, in
broad daylight and not even under the cover of darkness. They
were tied together, feet and feet and hands and hands, and in their
hideous death struggles they churned the water, for the edification
of the cruel crowd, until the last poor struggler had sunk to his
final rest. (See article by W. H. Davenport Adams, “Pains and

<p>All authorities agree that of all deaths crucifixion was the most
abhorrent, not only because of the pain resulting, but also because
of the shame of such a death. Cicero, in his Oration against Varres,
declared that it was impossible to find a fit word to describe such
an outrage as the crucifixion of a Roman citizen, yet the gentle
Galilean suffered this horrible death, with perfect resignation.</p>

<p>In applying the ordinary and extraordinary question, in France,
by means of the <i>estrapado</i>, an iron key was placed between the
palms of the accused’s hands, and they were tied behind his back
and, by means of a rope passed through a pulley, in the ceiling,
he was raised twelve inches above the floor with a weight of one
hundred and eighty pounds to his right foot. This was the “ordinary”
question. In applying the “extraordinary” interrogation, the same
process was used, but the accused was raised up to the ceiling,
with a two hundred and fifty pound weight tied to his foot, in a
running line, two or three times, with the result that he usually
swooned before the ceiling was reached the last time. (Gentleman’s
Magazine, Vol. 46, p. 504.)</p>

<p>A last will and testament is the instrument whereby
one disposes of his property, to take effect after his
death.<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The right to dispose of one’s property, by will, consistent
with existing rules of law, is one of the results
of man’s social condition, based upon an instinctive
sentiment, akin to self love, which looks to the preservation
and alienation, according to the intent of the
owner, of the individual acquisitions, resulting from
personal endeavor.</p>

<p>There is a vast amount of interesting information,
in connection with the history and forms of antique
wills, and testamentary dispositions of property, in
one form or another, are of extremely ancient origin.<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Historians and law writers have told us that the will,
as we know it, is a Roman invention, but in this statement
the testimony of others is accepted as establishing
the fact, rather than the knowledge, or want of
knowledge of the fact asserted. Indeed, writers are
frequently given to accepting and repeating the statements
of others, without investigating the facts upon
which such statements are based, much as the court did,
that decided that a given windstorm was not a cyclone,
where the conclusion was based wholly upon the evidence
showing that the clouds lacked the funnel shape<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
and circling motion, while the effect of the storm, evidenced
by the twisted trunks of giant trees, the houses
awry and other primary evidence of the fact asserted,
was wholly over-looked, in reaching the conclusion.<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>There is evidence that wills were used in Egypt
centuries before they were known in Europe;<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Solon
is said to have introduced them into Greece,<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and wills
were used in Rome, long before the date of the Twelve
Tables.<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Abraham, in his lament of the want of a legitimate
heir, appointed the steward and servant born in his
house to take his estate, after his death and this was,
virtually, the appointment of an heir by will.<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
the Hebrew Patriarch, Jacob, before taking his departure
from his sons, with the knowledge of approaching
death, said unto Joseph:<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Behold, I die; but God shall be with you and bring
you again unto the land of your fathers. Moreover, I
have given to thee, one portion above thy brethren,
which I took out of the land of the Amorite with my
sword and with my bow. And Jacob called unto his
sons and said, gather yourselves together, that I may
tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.”</p>

</div>

<p>Of course this is but an oral bequest, but it has all
the elements of a death-bed disposition, made under the
apprehension of approaching death and it sets forth the
“portion” to Joseph, after mentioning the derivation
of the testator’s title, and the symbolic emblems
to the other sons are distributed, with all the solemnity
of a will, in fact.</p>

<p>From these illustrations, it will be seen, that from
the beginning of the history of man, as we know him,
or at least in the patriarchial days of the ancient Hebrews,
the custom obtained of making testamentary dispositions
of property, and there is also evidence extant
that this custom was not confined alone to the ancient
Israelites.</p>

<p>An Egyptian will, dating back to patriarchial times,
was recently unearthed at Kahun, by the English Egyptologist,
William Petrie.<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> By this document, written
2548 B. C. one Sekrehen, a citizen of the time of Amenemhat
IV., settles upon his wife, Teta, all the property
given him by his brother, for life, with a condition
against the commission of waste, and one Siou, a lieutenant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
is appointed guardian for the infant children.
Two scribes attest the execution of this will in solemn
form and thus we have the indisputable evidence, by
this document executed forty-six hundred years ago,
that the statement of modern historians that wills are
of Roman origin and were invented by the clergy of
mediaeval times,<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> is in error.</p>

<p>The written will of the Assyrian monarch, Sennacherib,
assassinated in the year 681, B. C., is preserved in
the royal library of Kenyunjik<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and in the form customarily
used in that period, he bequeathed to his
son, Esarhadden, his bracelets, coronets and other gifts
of gold, ivory and precious stones, deposited, for safekeeping,
“in the temple of Nebo.”</p>

<p>The will of the philosopher, Plato, 348 B. C., who
left “no debts,” but devised his farms, with a provision
against alienation,<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> to his son, Adimantes, together
with his vase, gold, cash, slaves, “also all my chattels,
as specified in an inventory, held and possessed by
Demetrius,” is a model of brevity and concise legal
form, such as the experienced lawyer of today would
have prepared for his client.</p>

<p>The will of the great Aristotle, who, at sixty-eight
entered upon his final long sleep of death, in the year
322 B. C., after appointing Antipater his executor, with
other named friends to assist him in the management
and care of his estate, proceeds to dispose of his acquisitions,
in a most reasonable business-like manner,
from the provision for his daughter, in case of her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
marriage, including the disposition of his various
slaves, the finishing of his statues and the depositing
of the bones of his wife, Pythias, in his tomb, “even
as she desired,” to the final arrangements for the
offering of the four stone animals, for the preservation
of Nicanor, to Jupiter and Minerva, is just such
a sane, sensible testamentary provision as one would
expect from such an astute philosopher.<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Virgil died ten years before Christ and his will left
his manuscript of the Aeneid to his friends and executors,
Tucca and Varus, and divided his property between
his half-brother, Proculus and Valerius, after
leaving a fourth to Augustus, a twelfth to Macaenas
and the rest to Varus.<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>But we cannot devote more space in this chapter to
the wills of the most gifted of men of this ancient
period, however interesting it would be to follow the
testamentary devises of the statesmen, poets and philosophers
of the period before Christ, but to trace the
origin and growth of English wills, with a few illustrations
of the quaint and curious, will sufficiently lengthen
the scope of the present subject-matter.</p>

<p>Forms of testamentary disposition of personalty obtained
in Great Britain at a very early period,<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> but
until the Statute of Wills, in 1540,<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> there was no right
of disposition by will, in England, on the part of the
owner of real estate.<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span></p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon will is not a product of the Roman
will at all, but is purely a creature of the manners and
customs of the English people themselves.<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In the
early Anglo-Saxon law wills were unknown, but owed
their origin to the privilege accorded the crowned heads
and great ones to make testamentary disposition and
death-bed gifts of their property.<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> In Cnut’s day it
was not unusual for a man to make a post obit gift
of his land or goods, and after the Norman conquest
this custom continued and one could dispose of his land,
after his death, by a charter, effective upon his own
death, or that of his wife,<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> but the testamentary devise,
as we know it, was not a common instrument in
this day.</p>

<p>After the middle of the thirteenth century the king’s
court condemned the post obit gift of land, by charter,
but allowed it only in certain boroughs where the custom
obtained; primogeniture was held to destroy the
existing law of succession; the church asserted the right
to execute the last will and testament of every person
and the horror of intestacy increased, as the church
assumed the right to administer the goods of the deceased,
for the good of his soul.<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>We read, in the old books, that a great man, Eude,
died in Normandy, during the reign of Henry I., and
made a certain division or devise of his property, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
his manor to the abbey he had built at Colchester,
with a hundred pounds and a gold ring, together with
a cup and horse and mule; but before the King would
confirm the devise of the manor, he compelled the surrender
of the cup, horse and mule to the Crown.<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>And the post obit gift to Walden Abbey attempted
by William de Mandeville, Earl of Essex, during the
reign of Henry II. was also set aside by Geoffrey Fitz
Peter, one of Glanville’s successors as Chief Justiciar,<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
under Henry II., and his successor.</p>

<p>Of course the church-men frequently procured confirmations
from the heirs of these post obit gifts of
land to the church, by the threat of a dying father and
the disapprobation of the church, if the gift was not
confirmed, but in the law these gifts were not recognized,
for, as Glanville puts it, in this period it was
an axiom of the law that “God alone and not man can
make an heir.”<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Glanville speaks of the probate of wills, as if that
mode of authenticating these documents had been long
in use, when he wrote, but just when this custom was
crystalized into law, in England, it is difficult to determine.<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
In the reign of Henry III. the ecclesiastical
courts assumed jurisdiction in the probate of wills and
soon thereafter attempted quite generally to enforce
the execution of them in payment of legacies, for
since the reign of Henry I., the estate of one dying
intestate, was subject to division by those succeeding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
thereto, <i>pro anima ejus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The church seemed best
suited to make this division, for the benefit of the intestate’s
soul and this finally gave rise to the grant of
letters by the ordinary to the next of kin, from which
the custom of issuing letters of administration no doubt
arose, in after-times.<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The church continued to execute the powers concerning
wills and the estates of decedents—and this is no
doubt the reason why Glanville and Bracton do not
treat at length of wills, further than to mention the
custom, in certain boroughs, of devising land by will<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>—until
the people complained of oppression by the
bishops and ordinaries in the exaction of fines for probating
wills, when the statute of 31 Edward III., was
enacted, giving the justices of the king’s court jurisdiction
to enquire into such exactions and oppressions,
either at the instance of the king, or that of the injured
person.<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Having thus assumed the jurisdiction over the estates
of deceased persons, by this statute, which was
the entering wedge to oust the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical
courts, in the gradual processes of time, the
courts learned in the law, instead of those concerned
only about spiritual affairs, assumed larger control
and jurisdiction over the estates of decedents. While
the church retained control over the estates of decedents,
the bishop exercised practically the same authority
that the probate judge exercises under our law, in
the granting of letters of administration, the listing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
and inventorying of the property and the accounting
by the trustee to the ordinary, granting the letters of
administration.<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>From the delegation of the trust to some personal
friend to carry out the will of the decedent, the clergy,
in compelling fidelity in the performance of the trust,
no doubt developed that particular kind of a trustee
known to our law of today as an executor or administrator
and with the appearance of this legal personality,
the devise may be said to first legally assume
the dignity analogous to our present testamentary devise.<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>One of the earliest wills, with executors, that the
older books refer to, is that of King Henry II.,<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> made at
Waltham, in the year 1182 in the presence of ten witnesses,
among whom we note the name of Ranulf Glanville,
his justiciar, the author of the first English law
book. The English bishops and Glanville were to make
division among the religious houses of five thousand
marks; Norman bishops were to make division of certain
sums among Norman elemosinary institutions;
his sons were charged with the distribution of a fund
to be expended in providing marriages for poor free
women; God’s curse was invoked upon all those who
violate his laws and the Pope was said to have confirmed
the devise, no doubt because all the legacies were
for pious purposes. The will, however, had executors,<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
for one set of the trustees looked after the English
behests; another set after the Norman legacies; others,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
still, those left to institutions in Maine and Anjou, and
all of these several executors, save only Glanville, were
from among the clergy, and this evidences the high
regard in which this monarch held his learned justiciar.</p>

<p>But few of the thirteenth century wills have come
down to us, although we have an ampler supply in the
fourteenth century. In the thirteenth century, the will
was usually made in Latin and wills written in the
English language first began to appear generally in
the second half of the fourteen century.<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1268, or the 53 year of Henry III., William
de Beauchamp executed a will<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> that looks very like
the modern documents, except that it only provided for
specific legacies and behests of personalty other
than to the church. It provided that his horse, fully
harnessed, with all military caparisons, should precede
the hearse bearing his corpse; provided for masses for
his soul; gave a house to the church for his own soul
and that of his wife; a behest to his son, Walter, to
defray his expenses in a pilgrimage to the holy-land;
to his daughter, Joane, a canopy and a book of Lancelot;
a silver cup to his daughter Isabel, rings for his
friends, with small legacies to others and a house for
the church, are the principal features of this ancient
will. The testator finally closed this interesting old
will, in the following form:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And I appoint my eldest son, William, Earl of
Warwick, Sir Roger Mortimer, Sir Bartholomew de
Sudley, and the Abbots of Evesham and of Great
Malverne, my executors.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span></p>

<p>So here we have, in modern form, the recognition of
the custom to appoint executors, by testamentary devise,
just as today.</p>

<p>Primogeniture, under the feudal law of the middle
ages, in England, created the necessity for wills of real
estate, for although all children of the Germanic races
took equally and this was true, at Rome, under the
feudal law all the children were practically disinherited
in favor of the eldest son; some method of devising the
estate to the eldest son was essential, on the part of
the testator of real estate, so the Clergy adopted the
Roman will as the instrument for accomplishing the
purpose and thus it is sometimes called “an accidental
fruit of feudalism.”<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The liberty taken by the Church with the estates of
deceased persons was a matter of such scandal and
oppression, during the reigns of Henry III. and Edward
II., that Parliament on several occasions imposed
rules for the government of the bishops in the administration
of the estates of intestates. Executors were
required, during the reign of Henry III., to make a
true inventory of the property of the deceased, and
exhibit it to credible persons, acquainted with the
property of the deceased,<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and this is no doubt, the
foundation for this provision of our modern law, requiring
inventories, in such cases.</p>

<p>During the reign of Edward IV. the <i>testamentum</i> and
<i>ultima voluntas</i> came to be regarded in much the same
legal aspect, although the former was the more solemn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
act and the execution of the testament was always in
accordance with the forms prescribed in the older
law books and if these preliminaries were omitted it
was but a mere <i>ultima voluntas</i>.<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>In the reign of Edward VI. the reformers of that
period objected to the promiscuous use of wills by all
classes, so an act was passed preventing the execution
of wills by wives, <i>servi</i>, by minors under fourteen, by
heretics, criminals, condemned to death, exile, or chains;
those who did not dismiss their concubines before they
were in extremis, people with two wives or husbands,
libelers, prostitutes or procuresses and usurers. The
indulgence was granted to those keeping concubines,
however, and to those with two wives or husbands—perhaps
because of the leniency with which such crimes
were looked upon at this period—of disposing of their
goods <i>in pias causas</i>, or for the relief of the poor, afflicted,
for young women, the support of students and
the reparation of highways.<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Under the old law, the division of the decedent’s
property, whether by will or otherwise, was one-third
to his wife, a third to his children and the other third,
the owner himself could dispose of. If no will was left,
the wife and children took their one-third each and the
rest was divided by the administrator. If no children
survived, the widow took half and the owner could dispose
of the other half, or, if the owner died intestate,
the administrator disposed of the remaining half and
the same was true, if there were no children, but a
widow survived.<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span></p>

<p>The modern statutes of descents and distributions, in
the United States, are no doubt founded upon the customs,
which had taken the fixed form of law, at this
early period of English history.</p>

<p>In the written English wills that have come down to
us, from the middle ages, we find the dispositions of
property governed, largely, by the customs and laws
of the period when the will was written and the forms
and dispositions of property devised by these instruments
is as varied as the imaginations and whims of the
testators.</p>

<p>The will of Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick,
dated at Warwick Castle, Monday, next after the feast
of St. James, the Apostle, 1315, provided for the interment
of his body in the Abbey of Bordsley, without
funeral pomp. To Alice, his wife, he left a portion of
his plate, a crystal cup and half his bedding, with all
the books in his chapel; to his daughters, he left the
other half of his bedding, rings and jewels; to his son,
Thomas, he left his best coat of mail, helmet and suit
of harness, and to his son, John, he left his second best
coat of mail, helmet and harness, and the remainder
of his armour, bows, and other warlike implements were
to remain in Warwick castle, for his heir.<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Noticeable among the wills of the fourteenth century
is the specific provision for the place and manner of the
interment of the body of the deceased. The testators
of this period of the world’s history, prompted by their
superstition, wrote their wills as if they thought that
the angel of the Lord, on the resurrection day, would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
scan their wills, to find the place of their interment.
They talked “of graves, of worms, and epitaphs,” just
as the Great Bard makes the weak King Richard speak,
who had naught to bequeath, save his deposed body
“to the ground.”<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>We find that old John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster,
in 1399, directs, in his will,<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If I die out of London, I desire that the night my
body arrives there it be carried direct to the Friars
Carmelites, in Fleet Street, and the next day be taken
straight to St. Paul’s, and that it be not buried for
forty days, during which I charge my executors that
there be no embalming of my corpse.”</p>

</div>

<p>Sir Walter Manney, on St. Andrew’s day, in 1371,
in London, provided for his interment, “at God’s
pleasure,” in the midst of the Quire of the Carthusians,
near Smithfield, in the suburbs of London, without any
great pomp. He directed twenty masses be said for
his soul and that every poor person attending his
funeral, be given a penny to say a prayer for his soul
and the remission of his sins. He left ten pounds to
his sister, the nun, Mary; left a provision for each of
his two bastard daughters and to his dear wife, the
plate which he bought of Robert Francis, also a girdle
of gold, a garter of gold and all of his beds and girdles,
except his folding bed, which he left to his daughter of
Pembroke. He willed that a tomb of alabaster with
his own image thereon, as a knight and his arms thereon
should be constructed, like unto that of Sir John
Beauchamp, at Paul’s London, and that prayers should
be said for his soul and also for that of Alice de Henalt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
the Countess Marshal and Sir Guy Bryan, Knt., was
appointed executor of his will.<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Queen Katherine of Aragon, wife of Henry VIII.,
who died in 1536, after providing for the burial of
her body in the Convent of Observant Friars, supplicated
the King in her last will,<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> to return the property
that she had brought to him from Spain, out of which
she stipulated for the payment of the annual wages
due her physician, her druggist, her laundress, goldsmith
and tailor; she left the collar of gold she had
brought from Spain to her daughter and provided for
masses for her soul and legacies to different priests
and lady friends.</p>

<p>Harris, in his recent book on “Ancient, Curious and
Famous Wills,”<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> reproduces, verbatim, many curious
and strange testaments, evidencing the weaknesses,
humors, whims and caprices, and sometimes, even the
vengeance of the various testators, whose wills he has
collected.</p>

<p>William Pym, for instance, a gentleman of Somerset,
England, who crept to his long sleep of death on January
10’, 1608, after providing for different charitable
behests, thus speaks of his wife, in his will:<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I give to Agnes, which I did a long time take for
my wyfe—till she denyd me to be her husband, all
though wee were marryd with my friends’ consent, her
father, mother, and uncle at it; and now she sweareth
she will neither love mee nor evyr bee perswaded to,
by preechers, nor by any other, which hath happened
within these few years. And Toby Andrewes, the beginner,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
which I did see with mine own eyes when he
did more than was fitting and this, by means of others,
their abettors. I have lived a miserable life this six or
seven years, and now I leve the revenge to God—and
ten pounds to buy her a gret horse, for I could not,
this menny years, please her, with one gret enough.”</p>

</div>

<p>Dispositions of property for the use and benefit of
horses and other domestic animals are not uncommon,
in the list of quaint and curious wills to be met with by
the student of ancient testaments.</p>

<p>Harris cites the curious will of a childless peasant,
who died near Toulouse, in 1781, by the terms of which
he left his house and land and other property to his
riding horse, in these words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I declare that I appoint my russet cob my universal
heir, and I desire that he may belong to my nephew,
George.”</p>

</div>

<p>Upon the will being brought before the court for
construction, it was held that the intent of the testator
would be given effect and the horse and the bequests
he had bestowed upon it, would go to the nephew named
in the will.<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Madame Dupuis, who died in 1677,<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> left a legacy
of a fixed amount to her executor, with a detailed menu
for her cats, which her sister and niece were to visit
three times a week to see that at least thirty sous a
week were expended for their living and care.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the generosity and magnanimity
of certain Jews, the will of the wealthy Israelite,
Pinedo, who died at Amsterdam, in the eighteenth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
century, is not without interest. He left to the city of
his adoption, five tons of gold; to every Christian
church in Amsterdam and at the Hague, the sum of
10,000 florins each; to each Christian orphanage in
these two towns, 10,000 crowns; to the poor of Amsterdam,
forty shiploads of peat; to his synagogue two
and a half tons of gold; he lent to the government, at
three per cent, ten tons of gold, on condition that the
interest should be paid to the Jews domiciled at Jerusalem;
he then left certain legacies to his wife and
nephew and other members of his family and to every
unmarried person of either sex, attending his funeral,
100 florins; to every Christian priest at Amsterdam and
the Hague, 100 crowns and to every sacristan, fifty
crowns.<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Space will not permit the long list of charitable and
philanthropic devises that could be collated from ancient
and mediaeval times, which many of the testators
of today would do well to emulate.</p>

<p>John Wardell, of London, by his will dated August
29’, 1656, devised his tenement, called the “White
Bear,” in trust, to light the travelers passing to and
fro along the watersides.<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Charles Jones, of Lincoln’s Inn, by will dated January
17’, 1640, established a charitable trust for the
maintenance of a house to be used as a hospital, near
Pullhelly, for twelve poor men.<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>George Butler, of Coleshill, Warwickshire, by his
testament dated September 2’, 1591, gave his house<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
in trust for the lodgment of “any poor travelers” who
should desire lodgment, not to exceed one night.<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>And Valentine Goodman, of Hallaton, England, by
his will in 1684, left eight hundred pounds to be invested
and the interest spent for the benefit of the
“most indigent, poorest, aged, decrepit, miserable
paupers.”<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Among the freakish wills collected by Harris, may be
mentioned that of the nobleman of the house Du Chatelet,
who died in 1280,<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and directed that one of the
pillars of the church at Neufchateau should be hollowed
out and his body stood upright therein, so that the
vulgar might not walk upon his corpse.</p>

<p>The strange request of the great English jurist,
Jeremy Bentham,<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> that his corpse might be embalmed
and placed in his favorite chair at the banquet table
of his friends, on all occasions of state, was carefully
carried out by his friend, Dr. Southwood Smith. By
some scientific process the body of the philosopher and
law writer was preserved, by a French artist and in
his usual suit of clothes, with his broad-brimmed sombrero
and his favorite walking-stick, in his old armed-chair,
the lifeless body of this gifted man graced the
meetings of his friends, until it was removed by Dr.
Smith to University College.</p>

<p>The will of the great Bard of Avon, has been discussed
so frequently that its terms are known to many,
but as the last writing of the Poet, like everything connected
with his life, it is always of interest to posterity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span></p>

<p>The first paragraph of his will, along with the many
other prayers and Bible references which he places in
the mouths of his characters in the plays,<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> evidences
the Poet’s firm belief in Jesus Christ and the “life everlasting.”</p>

<p>In the entailment of his real estate to the bodily
heirs male of his daughters, this will evidences the
most careful legal preparation and the conclusion is
not unreasonable that the same discrimination which
characterizes this disposition of his real estate and
other property, recognized the futility of any attempted
disposal of his literary productions, which lacked the
attribute of property, in law, in England, until 1709.<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>His legacies to his sister and his nieces and nephews
is characteristic of his deep affection for his own
family; his benevolence is established by his bequests
to the “poor of Stratford”; his good-fellowship and
love for his friends by the many legacies for rings for
his different friends; his indifference toward his wife,
by the fact that he only left her his “second best bed,
with the furniture,” while all his landed acquisitions,
with his gold and silver plate and other property were
distributed among his sisters, daughters, nieces and
nephews and his trust and confidence in his daughter,
Susanna Hall, and her husband, John Hall, is finally
established by the fact that he made them his executors
and trustees.<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>The wills of the statesmen and patriots of the past<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
century, in our own country are equally interesting
with those of our brothers of yesterday across the sea.</p>

<p>After leaving his land in Nova Scotia, with his books
and the debts owing to him by his son, William Franklin,
former Governor of the Jerseys, the great statesman,
philosopher and patriot, Benjamin Franklin, referred
to his son’s part in attempting to deprive him of
his property, during the war, as an excuse for not leaving
him more of his estate. He left his dwelling house
and three new houses, printing office, silver plate and
household goods, to his daughter, Sarah Bache, and her
husband, in entirety with remainder to their heirs, “as
tenants in common and not as joint tenants.”<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The
picture of the king of France, set with four hundred
and eight diamonds, he left to his daughter, with the
admonition not to use the diamonds to make ornaments
for herself, so as not to thereby “introduce the expensive,
vain and useless pastime of wearing jewels in
this country.” He desired his philosophical instruments
in Philadelphia, to go to his ingenious friend,
Francis Hopkinson, and by a codicil, he left his “fine
crab-tree walking-stick” to his friend and “the friend
of mankind, General Washington. If it were a sceptre,
he has merited it and would become it. It was a present
to me from that excellent woman, Madame de Forbach,
the Dowager Duchess of Deux Ponts, connected
with some verses, which go with it.” He left a bond to
his son-in-law, on the condition that he manumit and
set free his negro man. This great patriot and friend
of mankind, like General Washington, in his last testament,
therefore, registered his opposition to human<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
slavery, an institution that was to be finally abolished
a half century later in the United States, through the
efforts of the great “Emancipator.”</p>

<p>The will of the great Chief Justice John Marshall,
is declared by him to be “entirely in my own handwriting”;
he left his estate equally to his only daughter
and his five sons and accompanying the will is a splendid
eulogy to his deceased wife, whom he characterized
as the “most affectionate of mothers.”<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The will of Captain Miles Standish, Longfellow’s
hero, was made March 7’, 1656. He desired his just
debts to “bee paied”; that his body should be “buried
in Decent manor ... as near as conveniently
may bee to my two daughters, Lora Standish, my
daughter, and Mary Standish, my daughter-in-law.”
His dear and loving wife, Barbara Standish, was left
a third of his estate; forty pounds were left to each of
four sons and to his son Josias, upon his marriage, he
left “one young horse, five sheep and two heifers,”
with his forty pound legacy, if his estate “will bear it
att p’sent.” His friends, Mr. Timothy Hatherly and
Capt. James Cudworth, were appointed “supervisors”
of his will, for he knew that they would “be pleased to
Doe the office of Christian love to bee healpfull to my
poor wife and Children by their Christian Counsell and
advice.”<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The “Father of our Country,” General George
Washington, left the bulk of his estate to his wife,
Martha Washington, for life,<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> with the “liquors and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
groceries” on hand at his death, to dispose of as she
saw fit. Upon her death he willed that all slaves owned
by him, in his own right, should have their freedom and
that the old and infirm and sick ones should be protected
and maintained by his heirs so long as they lived
and the younger ones educated and maintained the
same as other poor children.</p>

<p>He left the fifty shares in the Potomac Company,
given him for his services in the Revolutionary War, to
endow a University within the limits of the District of
Columbia; some of his lands were distributed among
the sons of his deceased brothers; his military and
state papers were left to his nephew, Bushrod Washington;
he recommitted the “box of oak that sheltered
the great Sir William Wallace,” to the Earl of Beuban;
to his brother, Charles, he left the gold headed cane
left him by Dr. Franklin and among the “mementos
of esteem and regard,” to his many friends, are a pair
of pistols to General De La Fayette. He desired that
in case of any dispute over his will that the disputants
select each an arbitrator, the two thus selected to
agree upon a third and the finding of any two as to
his intentions, he desired to be “as binding upon the
parties as if it had been given in the Supreme Court of
the United States.”</p>

<p>Like Washington, and many other of the patriots of
the past century, William Penn prepared his own will,
in 1718, so as to cause no little concern to his friend,
James Logan, as to the different constructions that
could be placed upon it.</p>

<p>The Government of the Province of “Pennsylvania
and territories thereto belonging,” he devised in trust<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
to the Earls of Oxford, Mortimer and Powelett, “and
their heirs, upon trust, to dispose thereof to the Queen”
or to any other person to the best advantage to carry
out the object of the devise.</p>

<p>He further devised to his wife, Hannah Penn; to
her father, Thomas Callowhill; to his sister, Margaret
Lowther; to his friends “Gilbert Heathcote Physitian,
Samuel Waldenfield, John Field, Henry Gouldney, all
living in England” and to his friends, Samuel Carpenter,
Richard Hill, Isaac Norris, Samuel Preston and
James Logan, “liveing in or near Pensilvania and their
heires” all his lands, tenements and hereditaments,
with “other profitts scituate, lyeing and being in Pensilvania
and the territores thereunto belonging,” in trust,
first for the payment of his debts, second, to convey
10,000 acres each to the three children of his son, William,
a like quantity to his daughter, Aubrey, and the
rest to be divided among the children of his present
wife, “in such proporcon and for such estates as my
said wife shall think fit.” His wife was made executrix
and all his personal estate was left to her.</p>

<p>Penn was a man of far more than the ordinary
ability and wisdom in the customary affairs of life, but
as his friend, James Logan, foresaw, from the contents
of this will, which left such a large and varied estate
to so many people to convey, with so little instructions
regarding his intentions, it is not strange that litigation
covering a period of nine years should have resulted
from such a testament.<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The searcher for the curious in testaments, will find
wills in poetry as well as in prose, collated in Harris’
Ancient Wills.</p>

<p>William Jackett, of the parish of St. Mary, Islington,
died in 1789 and his will in the following form was
admitted to probate:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span></p>

<p>William Hicklington, who dubbed himself, the Poet
of Pocklington, penned his will in rhyme, in 1770, as
follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Do give and bequeath,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As free as I breathe,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">In the year seventy.”<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Apropos this will, is the rhymed testament of the
sacriligious Irishman, who, as the old books record, in
this quatrain disposed of his earthly effects:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In the name of God, Amen:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My featherbed to my wife Jen;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Also my carpenter’s saw and hammer;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Until she marries; then, God damn her.”<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This, however, suggests the “Will in literature,”
and in turning over the pages of the work above referred
to, the “Lesser Testament,” of the plaintive
poet, Francois Villon, who died in 1484, is not without
interest.</p>

<p>His gloves and silken hood are bequeathed to a friend
in the following verse;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Item, my gloves and silken hood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My friend Jacques Cardon, I declare,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span></p>

<p>He desired his friends to record of him in his epitaph:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Acre or furrow had he none.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis known his all he gave away;</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Among the wills in fiction and poetry, collated by Mr.
Harris, in his recent work,<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> are those of Olivia, in
Twelfth Night; that of Don Quixote; the wills of
Dickens, George Eliot, Dumas and other English
writers. But it is not the object of this chapter to deal
with wills in fiction, since testaments are founded in
certainties, as real as life and death themselves. We
have always made our wills in pursuance of a natural
inclination, associated with the idea of property and
intimately connected with the ties that bind us here
on earth. As Hazlitt said, a century ago:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We consign our possessions to our next of kin, as
mechanically as we lean our heads on the pillow and go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
out of the world in the same state of stupid amazement
that we came into it.”</p>

</div>

<p>And as certain as we are to die, so certainly do we
owe it to ourselves and to those who are the objects
of our bounty, to provide for the proper disposition
of our acquisitions, even as the men and women of
antiquity did, before they pressed the pillow for the
last time.</p>

<p>The hands that wrote the wills referred to in the
foregoing pages have been stilled with the silence of
the centuries, e’en as the fingers that wove the figures
in your antique rug; the voice that expressed the
dying intent of the testator, like the nightingale that
sang among the trees—ah, “whither hath it gone again,
who knows” can be heard again no more. Like scattered
threads from the warp and woof of the lives from which
these skeins are taken, each age-scented document
marks the close of a human life and the fact that other
lives have fallen, like the leaves from trees, but emphasizes
the pathos of our lives, since humanity, as one
man, with a universal agony still strives and strains
“to gain the goal where agonies shall cease to be.”
Streams have been wept into the vast ocean of time
since the first will and testament was made by dying
man.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A myriad races came and went; this Sphinx hath
seen them come and go.”</p>

</div>

<p>True, a human life, is but “a drop in ocean’s boundless
tide,” but as truly said by Burton:<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The reason for recognizing, in law, a right of disposition of
property by will, is the same as the law governing the descent
and distribution, in case of intestacy. If there were no such provision,
on the vacancy of the property, on the death of the last
owner, an unseemly scramble would result, which would be both
undesirable and contrary to a sound public policy. “Title,” or
authority to make a will, is thus based upon the social instinct and
both wills and intestacy statutes are in furtherance of this purpose.
The owner, in case of a testamentary devise and the State, in case
of intestacy, as a mediary, accomplish practically the same purpose,
in the division of property, the prevention of a vacancy and the
failure of the social instinct, which furnishes the foundation for
society and order. (See interesting Essay by Professor Bigelow, in
III. Essays in Anglo-American Legal History, pp. 776, 778.)</p>

<p>The will of Penn, and other of the earlier patriots of the United
States who drew their own wills, in such manner as to cause
protracted litigation, suggests the old poem, tuned to the toast of
a century ago, “The lawyer’s best friend—the man who makes his
own will,” inscribed to “The jolly testator who makes his own will.”</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“He premises his wish and his purpose to save</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All dispute among friends when he’s laid in his grave;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Than a long summer’s day would give time to relate.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He writes and erases, he blunders and blots,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He produces such puzzles and Gordian knots,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That a lawyer, intending to frame the thing ill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Couldn’t match the testator who makes his own will.</div>
    <div class="center">...</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">You had better employ a conveyancer’s hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than encounter the risk that your will shouldn’t stand.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From the broad beaten track, when the traveler strays,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He may land in a bog, or be lost in a maze;</div>

<p>This bequest of Francois Villon, may have suggested to Mr. Williston
Fish of Chicago, the “Insane Man’s Will,” published in
Harper’s Weekly, in 1898, wherein he makes an imaginary will
that has become a classic in English literature, among the bequests
being “all good little words of praise and encouragement,” to good
fathers and mothers, in trust for their children; to children, subject
to the rights of lovers, he devises, the flowers, the banks of
brooks, the blossoms of the woods, the golden sands and waters of
the brooks, the white clouds floating high over the giant trees and
the Milky Way, to wonder at, at night; to lovers, he devises the
imaginary world, with the stars in the sky, the red roses by the
wall, the sweet strains of music and all else by which they may
figure to each other the lastingness and beauty of their love. To
those no longer children or lovers, he bequeaths the pleasures of
sweet memories, the poems of Burns and Shakespeare and other
poets, and to those with snowy crowns he leaves the happiness of
old age, with the love and gratitude of their children, until they
fall asleep.</p>
